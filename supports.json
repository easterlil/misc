        "Hello, Professor! You're really on the move today. A lot to get done, I take it? I'm happy to help. Tell me, is there anything I can do to lighten your load a bit?",
        "Oh, surely there must be something! Don't be shy about asking for help. We're practically siblings, after all. Cut from the same cloth. I was raised by [[Jeralt]], just as you were. So we should have no trouble getting along.",
        "My parents died when I was small, and I came to live in the [[Garreg Mach Monastery|monastery]]. It was an aimless existence. But sometimes, a knight would pass by, wearing magnificent armor. That knight was Jeralt. And the first time he laid his eyes on me, he made me his squire! What was he thinking, eh?",
        "No kidding! I don't think I'll ever fully understand his logic. Later, I heard that the squire preceding me had died of a terrible plague. I looked a bit like him, and was about the same age, so Jeralt thought me a suitable replacement. A little nutty, old Jeralt, there's no doubt about that. Quite a character. All that was more than 30 years ago. How time flies.",
        "Well, Jeralt hardly seems to have aged since then. In fact, over drinks he once told me... Ah, perhaps that's a story for another day. At any rate, that's Jeralt for you. One of a kind. I don't think there's anyone else quite like him.",
        "Right. Well, now you've heard my whole story. I hope you understand now why I feel such a strong sense of attachment to you. If you're ever in a bind, just give me a holler. I'll help however I can.",
        "Indeed, indeed. Well, I'll let you get back to it. But truly, if I can take anything off your plate, don't hesitate to let me know.",
        "Hello, Professor. What brings you here? Fancy a bit of fishing?",
        "You know, I can hardly go fishing without thinking of ol' Jeralt. He and I would just sit here, casting our lines again and again. I'm no better at it now than I was then! Not a single nibble.",
        "I was hopeless at it, but he was a master. In the time it took me to catch a fish, he could fill his basket to the brim. You know, talking to you, I'm feeling very nostalgic. Why don't you join me? We can trade stories about the old man.",
        "We spoke before about how Jeralt never seemed to age, right? Once, when he was drunk, he let the secret slip. He said he'd had an infusion of [[Crest]]-bearing blood, and it had greatly extended his life.",
        "Well, we'd both been drinking. I figured he was joking, so I just laughed it off. Then I asked him his age. He said he'd stopped counting after he hit one hundred. And he was telling the truth! In those 20 years he was away, he didn't age a bit. An incredible person, to be sure. And I probably don't know the half of it. Actually, I'd... I'd like to ask you something about Jeralt, if you don't mind. When Jeralt was away from the monastery, what was he like?",
        "I have to say, right now, fishing with you, it really takes me back. This feels just like the good ol' days, when Jeralt was sitting alongside me...",
        "Ah, there you are. Hello.",
        "Oh, yes. Apologies. I'm struggling with some unpleasant thoughts. Since the war began, I've ended so many lives. You and your students got your hands dirty as well. Nobody forced you all to join the fight, of course. You did so of your own volition. Still. There must be something very wrong with the world, for it to make children into killers.",
        "That's true enough. We've all gotten older. Ah, listen to me! I'm sorry for being so glum.",
        "Well said! In truth, I don't think my expression will improve my looks. I'm a brute, no matter what face I pull! Ah, you really are just like Jeralt. When I was down in the dumps, he'd cheer me up with a playful quip. He gave me his library of jokes. But when I tell one of them, nobody laughs at the punchline. They laugh at me! You, on the other hand. You inherited the old man's comic talents. I'm feeling pretty perky now, all thanks to you. I can't stop this war by feeling gloomy about it. Onward! To a brighter future.",
        "To tell you the truth, that was another line I picked up from Jeralt. He taught me everything about life. He was more important to me than anyone in the world. Apart from you, perhaps.",
        "When I look at you or see you fighting in battle, it's like I'm seeing a sibling. But at the same time... it's like seeing something sacred and powerful. Something I must defend. You're so important to the future of Fódlan... And to me. I promise to continue protecting you, with the strength of a knight and the love of a big brother.",
        "You're welcome to return the favor, should you feel so inclined!",
        "Hey, what're you doing here? Waiting for someone?",
        "Anyway... Things seem to have quieted down across all of Fódlan. But we can't slow down now! The work's only just begun! In fact, we'll probably be busier than ever.",
        "But when we've got a little breathing room, I'd like to go fishing with you. We can sit by the water together and idly cast our lines, not a care in the world... Ah, ahem. It occurs to me. Were you really waiting for someone? A little rendezvous, perhaps?",
        "I'm sorry. It's just, when it comes to your life, I get emotional, you know? You've...you've done so well. You've persisted through so many obstacles, and you just kept on fighting. I have no doubt Captain Jeralt's looking down proudly from heaven right now. And of course, I'm proud of you too. I'm a very proud big brother.",
        "You could have let that one slide...",
        "Hello, Professor! You're really on the move today. A lot to get done, I take it? I'm happy to help. Tell me, is there anything I can do to lighten your load a bit?",

        "You could have let that one slide...",
        "Your Highness, missing the day's training? How unlike you!",
        "Yes, it's really coming down out there. Makes it hard to go outside, I suppose. It's pouring so hard, I can't help but feel \"pourly\"!",
        "Sorry, that one was pretty bad. I think this weather is putting a damper on my sense of humor.",
        "Ah yes. You seem to have the time to spare, so would you help me organize our stock of weapons? You must know a thing or two about weapons, and I bet you're no slouch at physical labor.",
        "I appreciate it. I don't know how I'd do it all on my own! You know, it's great that you're willing to help with this kind of thing. Some nobles are so self—important. You're a real go—getter, Your Highness! Or should I say, Your Spryness?",
        "Listen, Your Highness. That joke, I... I didn't mean to...",
        "Huh?",
        "Wait, you mean, you actually found it funny?",
        "I see...",
        "That's not exactly what I was going for. Still, I don't think I've ever seen you laugh so loudly.",
        "\"This talent,\" hm? Is that your way of saying I'm no good at telling jokes?",
        "That does it. Next time I make you laugh, I'm gonna make you admit it was a good, quality joke! Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to cook up some top—notch rib—ticklers!",
        "Ungh... We should have been more careful. Those monsters really got the better of us.",
        "No, no, it's all right. We've got more important things to do than dwell on our mistakes.",
        "We weren't expecting that attack, after all. It gave us a nasty shock. So we can't just leave. The knights could use some inspiration. Listen up, everyone! We're going to carve ourselves a safe path back home to Garreg Mach Monastery!",
        "But first, I want you all to hear me out!",
        "A long time ago, Captain Jeralt and I defended a small village from a band of thieves. After we defeated those hoodlums, the captain observed how ugly they were. \"Such hideousness ought to be illegal,\" he said. \"If it were up to me, I would've bandit!\"",
        "Then he walked up to the leader of the village and handed over a big bag of coins! \"A gift from the thieves,\" he said. \"They were dying to give it to you.\"",
        "Hm?",
        "Ah, I don't know! I'm just a natural!",
        "Dimitri! Just the man I was looking for. I wanted to thank you for your help.",
        "Don't tell me you've forgotten! Your help when the monsters attacked.",
        "Hm. When you put it like that, I feel like you're the one who's kidding. Even I knew those jokes were awful. I was trying to think on my feet, to raise the soldiers' spirits.",
        "You're the only reason the gags didn't fall flat! If you hadn't started laughing when you did...",
        "Yeah? You think? I never thought about it like that. But if you say so, maybe I do have a knack for this!",
        "Sure, I'm happy to help, if you want to be as lousy a joker as I am! You could surely find a better teacher somewhere else. In the stables, for example.",
        "I see. Well, I guess I can't say no! I hope you're ready to become a wizard of wit!",
        "Very good, that's what I like to hear. Soon you'll be cracking wise like there's no tomorrow. Everyone will think you're a pun in the neck!",
        "OK, I must drop off these papers with Bernadetta. I'm not sure how to go about this. She's as timid as a mouse—and that's when speaking to people her own age! She'll likely scream the second she sees me. Maybe this is a mistake. All that noise is going to frighten the other students.",
        "Ah, hello! I have some business with Bernadetta. I wasn't sure how to approach her.",
        "I was supposed to deliver this, you see. Perhaps you can take it off my hands?",
        "No trouble at all! Here it is.",
        "Whew, that's quite a relief. How kind of Bernadetta's friend, making that delivery for me.",
        "Wait a second... That was Bernadetta! But it couldn't have been! She spoke so...normally. She didn't act frightened at all. In fact, she was quite friendly! Ouch! Yes, it still hurts when I pinch my cheek, so I'm not dreaming... Hm, I'm glad the ordeal's done with, but now I feel terribly confused. And a little worried. Meek little Bernadetta, what have they done to you?",
        "There she is—and she seems to be alone. Now's my chance. Bernadetta, hello! May I ask you something?",
        "Hold on, hold on! Please calm down. It's just me.",
        "That's right. Your denials really piqued my curiosity, but I'm glad you've calmed down.",
        "I did. Listen... You're always so skittish—just now, for example. But when you saw it was me, you were fine. Why is that? It's been on my mind since I delivered that package. You don't seem scared of me at all.",
        "What? Oh no, certainly not. I was just making an observation.",
        "Ah, so that's why! At last the mystery's solved. Your uncle and I must be quite alike. Is it my face, my physique?",
        "My personality?",
        "Well, I'm honored to hear you say so. I'd like to meet this uncle of yours. He sounds like a genial fellow. Whereabouts does he live?",
        "Bernadetta, do you have a moment?",
        "Hold on! It's me, Alois. Calm down.",
        "Hm. I can't help but wonder about these hats you were looking at... But I'll set that aside for now. I wanted to apologize for being insensitive. I can't believe I trampled on your emotions like that.",
        "About your dear uncle. It never crossed my mind that he might have passed away.",
        "But it clearly upset you. I can't even express how guilty I feel about opening an old wound like that. I'm so sorry.",
        "Is that so? Hm. Well then, why did you look so sad when I mentioned him?",
        "I see. He must have been quite dear to you.",
        "You want me to visit your uncle's grave? But I don't have any connection with him.",
        "I didn't think of that... All right, then. I accept. If you don't mind my tagging along, I'll gladly accompany you!",
        "Hahaha!",
        "Waaagh! Who goes there?! Oh, Petra, it's you. You appeared out of nowhere.",
        "Sure, I don't mind. I'll answer your question.",
        "Ah, you need a lesson on breaking the ice. That's a slippery subject, but I bet we can crack it!",
        "Now, let's see. The crucial thing is to start conversations. Be proactive about saying hello. Ask questions. Also, it might help to stop sneaking up on people.",
        "You can always try throwing in a joke, to lighten the mood. The trick is to keep trying, so you get practice. Put your best food forward—and try not to put it in your mouth!",
        "Oh, I, uh... I just made a little joke.",
        "Well, uh, \"Put your best foot forward,\" that's an expression people say that means, \"Try as hard as you can.\" And \"putting your foot in your mouth\" doesn't really mean what it sounds like... When you \"put your foot in your mouth,\" you are saying something rude without meaning to, and so... Gah! What am I going on about? There's nothing worse than trying to explain a joke.",
        "Petra? You've gone awfully quiet. I suppose you've lost faith in me as a conversation tutor.",
        "You admire me? Oh Petra, no need to say kind things out of pity, you didn't hurt my feelings.",
        "If you were sincerely compliment me, then no. To think—you just started learning how to chitchat, and you've already got a silver tongue. You really put your money where your mouth is!",
        "I've shared a fair number of jokes with Petra by now. Though, there is a strange shame in having to explain them all in detail. Ah! Is that Petra? She's talking to some kids...",
        "Hey, Petra. What were you saying just now?",
        "Oh! Wait, are you going to try using—",
        "Wait! I think you mean, \"breaking the ice.\" You sure broke something there.",
        "Hah, ahem. What I meant was—",
        "I don't know if I'd say \"genius,\" per se...",
        "They seem more shocked than amused.",
        "Petra seems to be headed in a strange direction. But it is her choice... If she starts telling lots of bad jokes, I hope the people of Brigid don't come after me. Not my fault!",
        "Mercedes, hello! I have a request for you.",
        "A little birdie told me you're good at telling ghost stories.",
        "So it's true! Excellent. I'd like to hear one of your finest ghost stories. Would you be amenable?",
        "W-wait a moment!",
        "I was only asking whether you'd tell me. The telling itself will have to be another time.",
        "No, I have to steel myself.. Er, I mean, I have something important to do!",
        "Well, you see, ah, ghosts... terrify me. But I'm a knight. Someday, somewhere, I may have to deal with one!",
        "Yes. It's quite embarrassing.",
        "Oh, it's nothing, really...",
        "It needn't be your very scariest! A moderately scary story will suffice. Thank you for taking the time.",
        "You have? Well, ah, excellent! I won't run or hide.",
        "Wait! Wait, wait, wait...",
        "You got to the graveyard part so quickly! No warning at all. I wasn't ready. Oh, listen to me! What kind of knight am I? Continue, Mercedes. I won't make another peep.",
        "Ghuahh!",
        "AAAAAHH! What happened?! Is it over?! I blacked out after the part with the misshapen figure. Ungh, I'm so pathetic! I'm a knight! I have to be ready to fight anywhere, even in a... spooky graveyard!",
        "Precisely. Please, Mercedes, help me prepare!",
        "Is it over?",
        "Oh, Mercedes, thank you! And I didn't cover my ears even once!",
        "You want to join the Knights of Seiros?",
        "Hm. I think the [[Knights of Seiros]] wouldn't be quite what you expect. As a knight myself, I slew countless foes. I shudder at the memory of my own deeds. The corpses I made, heaped in a pile, would be like a mountain. I suppose that's why I'm so frightened of ghosts. What if they appear before me, seeking revenge? Perhaps it's a silly thing to worry about, but... still.",
        "I see. What would your parents think about you planning to become a knight?",
        "Before you talk to them, I had better relate some of the darker chapters in the knights' history. It's your turn to listen, Mercedes.",
        "Eh, pardon?",
        "Oh, well, you needn't go to any trouble...",
        "I... suppose that's true. Thank you.",
        "You'd like to hear about Jeralt's adventures? You seem quite taken with these stories, Leonie.",
        "Ah! It all feels like ancient history now. You see, the captain was visiting the Kingdom of Faerghus.",
        "His previous squire had died from a ghastly plague. Then one day, he came upon me and appointed me his new squire.",
        "Oh, no, it wasn't that. I was just an orphan boy living in the monastery. I was a timid little thing.",
        "My face looked like the dead boy's.",
        "I asked the captain and that was the only answer he gave me.",
        "Yes. In those early days, I would sometimes wonder whether he was right in the head. When I saw him on the battlefield, though, those concerns were laid to rest. Anyway... I think I hear your professor has been looking for you. You'd better scram.",
        "I've told you so many! I don't have an endless supply, you know. There is one that comes to mind, however— that time the captain nearly killed me!",
        "It wasn't that I had done anything wrong. That wouldn't be much of a story, would it? No. We were at an inn, making merry. Suddenly, the other guests began to gather around the captain. They wanted him to put on a show, to entertain them with his skills.",
        "That's right! He had a hatchet, and they asked him to hit targets with it.",
        "Indeed, indeed. Then the captain tells me, \"Put this apple on your head, and stand over there.\"",
        "That was the idea, but the hatchet fell short of my head, nearly striking me square in the chest! If I hadn't gotten out of the way, that inn would have been my grave.",
        "True. Injuries take their toll on a man's dexterity.",
        "Regardless—a master swordsman, that Captain Jeralt. Even with the hatchet, now that I think of it... I never saw him miss in the training yard.",
        "Yes, that just dawned on me. Throwing that hatchet, he shouldn't have missed so badly.",
        "I'm not sure! What if the captain was, in fact, trying to kill me?!",
        "Yes. Certainly an eccentric man. Sometimes, Leonie, you quite remind me of him.",
        "Hah! You skipped right to the conclusion. That's exactly what Jeralt would do.",
        "That might not be the finest trait of his to emulate. In the end, if you want to join the Knights of Seiros, it comes down to combat skill. Regardless, I'm happy to hear you say all this.  That might not be the finest trait of his to emulate. In the end, it comes down to combat skill. Regardless, I'm happy to hear you say all this.",
        "I've strived to become a knight at the level of Captain Jeralt. But I'm an old man. I've come to accept that... I will never be his match.",
        "No, no. It's quite all right. I know myself and what I'm capable of. But you're still young. Youth is a weapon of the utmost power. Infinity possibility. We are both inspired by Captain Jeralt, so I hereby bequeath to you my lofty ambitions.",
        "No need to cry, Leonie. I'm relieved. My dream is in good hands with you. Captain Jeralt is looking down proudly on you, I'm sure. Will you carry on his legacy?",
        "Leonie... Uh... Do you remember the story I told you once, about what happened at the inn?",
        "Jeralt ran up quite a tab with all his drinking, and he left without paying. Now his debt is due. And, as you have declared that you'll carry on his legacy... You see where I'm going with this.",
        "Nothing to do with me either. I don't drink. Even so, all this time, I've been paying it back little by little. And it's not just that one place. He owes money in towns all over Fódlan. I haven't been able to step into a tavern anywhere without being badgered for payment. So exhausting! But now I can say that the debts are for you to cover! You're still young, so I'm sure you'll manage in time. Thank you, Leonie!",
        "Professor!",
        "I came in through the... door.",
        "I'm looking to enlist the services of a magic wielder. I thought you might be the man for the job.",
        "You were a teacher, weren't you?",
        "Slow down there! I heard a rumor you were looking for novice magic users. Did I hear wrong, or am I just an unsuitable student? Were you hoping for another young girl instead?",
        "Wait! Hold on, Professor Hanneman. I'm no good at magic. And for a long time, I've been hoping to improve my skills. Some of the other knights look down on me for having no Crest and no magical skill. I can't do anything about the Crest. But the magic, maybe that's a different story. Please, I want to learn. You've got to help me.",
        "Hah, of course, how marvelous! I look forward to training with you, then!",
        "Professor Hanneman! What do you think of my progress so far?",
        "Ah, I see. I suppose I need to give it a little more of that Alois oomph!",
        "Come again? I didn't quite catch that.",
        "All right. I've been wondering, why did you agree to train me in the first place? When I told everyone you were teaching me, ha! They could hardly believe it.",
        "That's a surprise. A Crest scholar researching people without Crests?",
        "Ah, that's wonderful! What a great man you are, Professor Hanneman. Truly, a man among men! Why, if I could prove it's possible to use magic without a Crest, what an honor that would be! Please, use me as you see fit! I won't let you down, I promise!",
        "Oh, no! I'm ready to go! Let's make a breakthrough! Come on, Hanneman! You should be shouting too! A bright future awaits!",
        "Oh, I meant to tell you. I have some friends who struggle with magic as well. I'll ask them to help! Perhaps if we all chip in, we can make your dream a reality. Onward!",
        "Ah, perfect! I was just looking for someone to dine with. Let's raid the dining hall, shall we?",
        "Manuela, I have some news. I received a letter from my wife today.",
        "My daughter just picked up a new skill! Can you guess what it might be?",
        "That's right! Spot on, as always. My wife is teaching her the basics.",
        "Next time I'm home, my daughter will be able to cook me all my favorite meals. What a lucky father I am! Is any father in the world luckier than I?",
        "My wife greeting me at the door. My daughter's nervous face as she sets the meal on the table. I'm so excited, I bet I won't even be able to taste the food as I devour it.",
        "Then I'll say, \"How delicious! That was the second best meal I've ever had.\"",
        "\"Mommy's cooking is the best, but you're a close runner-up, darling!\"",
        "\"Oh, Daddy, I'm so happy you liked it,\" she'll say, as she embraces me, a big smile on her little face. Ah! What could make a man happier?",
        "Manuela! There's something I must discuss with you.",
        "I'm in dire straits. Can you help me think of a gift for my daughter? Her birthday's just around the corner, and I can't think of anything to send her. Frankly, though I've sent her some wonderful gifts over the years, she never seems too excited about them. So, this year, I want to send her something special. Something that she'll gush about!",
        "Oh, please, have a heart! Can't you help me at all? This is an emergency! I've been racking my brain. I have no idea what she might like, and time's running out. I thought that a young woman such as yourself might be able to help.",
        "Ah, of course! Anything for a young, charming beauty such as yourself! I can think of none worthier of that description!",
        "Oh, thank you! In that case, will you come shopping with me when you're done for the day?",
        "Well, for the past few years, I've been sending her ancient coins.",
        "Coins, I said, from ancient civilizations! I've been diligently collecting them and passing them on. They're precious and historically significant! The makings of a great gift, don't you think? ...Is something wrong?",
        "I'm sure that, for the right person, such a gift would be exquisite.",
        "I can't express enough how grateful I am for your help with my daughter. She was over the moon about the gift you chose.",
        "I even received a thank-you letter from her. Would you care to read it?",
        "Don't worry. Look who it's addressed to.",
        "That's my daughter for you! Perceptive. She can see right through my little schemes.",
        "She does, doesn't she? That reminds me of when she was younger. She always used to—",
        "Very well, another time. But I would still like to show my appreciation. A knight never takes kindness for granted. What can I do for you?",
        "In that case, I hope my words of gratitude will suffice as repayment. I am truly thankful for your help this time. And the next...",
        "Well, my wife's birthday is coming up... So, of course, I'm going to need all the help I can get from my gift-selection advisor!",
        "Aha, finally! Nothing?! I could have sworn I felt a bite... Regardless I shall persist!",
        "Why, if it isn't Gilbert! Everything's splendid. I am fishing, as you can see.",
        "Well, a fish escaped, so I started shouting/ See, they're biting all right. I think I'm reeling them in too slowly... Oho! Another! Grr, nothing, again? Why do these darn things elude me? I've been at it since yesterday. Every time I feel a pull on my line, the fish escapes.",
        "Hm? Well, yes, of course I did. That way, the fish has less time to escape.",
        "OH. I've been reeling in too quickly? Maybe that's why the little flipper flappers have been getting away. You seem to know your stuff, Gilbert! Do you fancy yourself an angler?",
        "Ah, is that so? Well, I'm glad to have met a fellow enthusiast. I fish quite often! Although I catch fish quite rarely... Regardless, color me impressed! A master-of-arms, but also a master of the fishing rod.",
        "Oho, splendid! You shall be my second fishing mentor. My rise in skill will be astronomical!",
        "How goes it, Gilbert?",
        "Oh no, no. I was passing by. Please, carry on. Hold on... You haven't caught a single fish yet. Are you feeling unwell?",
        "So you're fishing, but not in hopes of catching a fish? How unusual. Oh, I see! You're a vegetarian!",
        "Hm. That is, ah...",
        "Ah, no need, Gilbert. A thought occurs to me.",
        "It was Captain Jeralt who first taught me how to fish. We had spare time between missions, and he said it was the perfect hobby.",
        "He was always looking out on the water as though lost in thought. Perhaps he wasn't fishing to catch either. Perhaps he was facing something within himself. Silently struggling with his thoughts and hiding the struggle from me and everyone else.",
        "Yes, that's true... Very well! I will join you today after all. Please teach me this art of fishing without fishing. I think it would do me some good to faze on the water and think fondly about my old mentor.",
        "Ah, Catherine! How could I refuse?",
        "I couldn't agree more! It feels like a weight's been lifted from my shoulders. It's at times like this, when worldly worries fall away, that I can really live in the moment. It's intoxicating.",
        "Ah yes, were you the fellow selling ancient coins?",
        "By a Hero? A thousand years ago? I'll take it! How much do I owe you?",
        "Argh! You're saying that whole story was a lie?",
        "You know, Catherine, you really saved my hide. If not for you, I would have bought that phony coin! So I just wanted to say: money thanks! Really, I coin't begin to express my gratitude!",
        "Hm... Yes, you make a good point. I'll try to be more cautious from now on.",
        "Good day, ma'am. Do you need anything?",
        "I'm so sorry about your troubles. I don't have much on me, but here...",
        "Wh-what? You don't mean she was trying to...",
        "How embarrassing.",
        "I've always believed that to earn others' trust, you have to be trusting.",
        "I couldn't help but overhear. Hello, Anna. How much does she owe?",
        "I'm in your debt, Catherine. You've saved me countless times. Besides, you warned me about those scams. You kept me from getting cheated out of my money. So I'll take care of this. How much does she owe?",
        "Of course I don't! Think nothing of it. I used to pay old Jeralt's tabs all the time. I'd have been happy to buy you a drink, you know.",
        "Jeralt would've kept drinking. He was certainly shameless about it.",
        "Sometimes. Honestly, off the battlefield, he was disorganized about everything.",
        "I appreciate that, but there's no rush. I trust you. You're a colleague, a friend. And that's true whether or not you pay me back!",
        "Uh, yes, let's.",
        "Oh, I'm still the same old Alois! Come on, let's head back before nightfall.",
        "Shamir, can I ask you a stupid question?",
        "You're a skilled sniper. You've completed countless missions. And in the process, you've taken countless lives.",
        "After a mission, do you ever think about the people you killed?",
        "I see... I guess that's the best way, huh? There's no point dwelling on it.",
        "I've got everything packed up. I'm going to head back now. You should head home as well, before it gets too dark.",
        "WHAAAARGH! A GHOST! I'm sorry! Forgive me, forgive me! Please, forgive me!",
        "Th-that voice, it's...Shamir? Ah, it's Shamir! Whew... You frightened me. My heart was beating so hard, I thought it would burst out my nose.",
        "Can you try not to be so stealthy when you're approaching a fellow knight?",
        "Uh...I suppose there's no point in hiding it. I'm terrified of them.",
        "No, no. I want to get it off my chest. That time when we were on our way back from a mission. Do you remember what I asked you?",
        "Yes, you said you never do, but me, I... I can't go a day without thinking about them. The feel of my weapon cutting through them, their twisted faces, their cries of pain. And that awful scent of blood... I was carrying out my duties. But...but that doesn't make it easier for me to forget. And the dead haven't forgotten me either. Their hatred, their resentment, their curses... One day, the spirits will set upon me for revenge!",
        "Oof!",
        "Yes, thanks... I needed that.",
        "Listen, Shamir. I want to apologize for the conversation we had. I really embarrassed myself.",
        "I just want to make one thing clear. I don't resent my missions as a knight. I will complete any mission I'm told to carry out.",
        "I think I am a coward, actually. Every night I fret about ghosts that don't really exist. I wish I could be as strong as you are. The fact is, I'm weak. There's nothing I can do to change it.",
        "Shamir...",
        "I see! That makes sense! Optimism! Cheery old Alois, that's me!",
        "Shamir! Stop lagging, start legging!"

        "Hello, Professor. Do you have a moment?",
        "Well, I have this book of battle tactics that I borrowed from one of the knights. There's one part that I just don't understand. Do you think you could explain it to me?",
        "I don't get why the knights are grouping up in that forest there. I just can't see the advantage to a formation like that.",
        "Yay! I finally get it! You really are a great teacher.",
        "I just love learning new things. That's why I came to the [[Officers Academy]]. I want to learn magic, battle tactics, martial arts, and, and... Well, all kinds of stuff! I'm learning more now than I have in my whole entire life! Speaking of, I'd better go visit the library for some research before magic practice, which is just before sword training...",
        "That's just not possible! I always find it's more tiring to laze around doing nothing. I've never been any good at that. I have to have something to do. Like, on my days off, I need to get up early and take care of the cleaning first, or I just...can't relax. Know what I mean?",
        "Not to mention... Oh wait... Oh no! I was supposed to be on cooking duty today! I completely forgot! Sorry, Professor, but I have to run! Thanks again for your help!",
        "'''' Argh! Who put this stupid barrel here?",
        "I'm so sorry, Professor... I somehow overslept and missed our training session. I didn't mean to cause you and the others so much trouble.",
        "It's just...when I'm studying tactics, I lose track of time, and... Oh, who am I kidding? I've always been like this.",
        "Before I came to the Officers Academy, I was a student at the school of sorcery in [[Fhirdiad]]. Even back then, I was pulling all-nighters well before the exams. And I never even noticed I was harming myself. I'm just too focused on my goal. I know I've already told you this, but I really love to learn new things. It's a passion of sorts. I first realized I had the learning bug when I was about four or five years old. My father was so happy to see me using magic... Seeing him happy made me happy too, and that made me want to work even harder. If only things could have stayed like that...",
        "When I was about 13, [[Gilbert|my father]] left home. He was a devout man, so I figured he'd gone to the monastery. That's why I went to the school of sorcery, so that I could eventually get accepted at the Officers Academy. I studied harder than ever, and sure enough, I finally earned a referral. Unfortunately, my passion for learning became more of an obsession. I got so focused, I kind of forgot how to relax. It feels like I've been running in circles ever since.",
        "OK, it's decided. From now on, I'll try my best not to try my best!",
        "From now on, if you see me going overboard, just let me know. I'm a new woman, after all!",
        "Oh. Hi, Professor.",
        "Do you remember what we talked about before? About doing my best to not do my best? Well, I've been pretty busy recently, and despite my best efforts, I've been trying way too hard... I was busy all day yesterday with training and work. I just couldn't help myself! That's why I decided to take a day off today. It's just... Now that I have a day off, I don't know what to do with myself! Please, you have to help me! What should I do?",
        "Got it! I'll try that right now! Mmm! This candy is so sweet and delicious! And it goes so well with piping hot tea! Ooh, and speaking of the tea, your brewing skills are incredible! I'd love to be able to make such nice tea, but... Oh, Professor! Will you teach me how to brew tea like this? I'll do my best to learn, and then I'll make delicious tea for you as thanks!",
        "Oh... Um, sorry. Back to my old tricks, it seems... Oh! Why is it so difficult to not do my best?! I try and try not to try, but it just doesn't work!",
        "Professor... You're right! Doing nothing is just not my style! To be myself, I've got to do my best every day!",
        "OK! Then you really must teach me how to make such delicious tea! You will, won't you? Please! Oh, and also... Well, thank you. You've listened to me and helped me face my troubles. Now I feel like I can talk to you about anything. Honestly, I wish we could go on drinking tea like this forever...",
        "There you are! Everybody's been looking for you. It must be hard being so popular. I bet it's a whole lot of work too... If I'm being honest, I'm a little bit envious.",
        "After each battle, there's always more to do, so every day is exciting in its own way. Though it's true I haven't been able to relax for a while...no matter where I go or what I do. OK, so I finally realized why it is I feel this way. It's because...I need you.",
        "When I'm with you, I feel like I can be myself. It's not a matter of doing my best or not doing my best... What really affects my happiness is whether I'm with you or not. Hehe! Um, actually, I've practiced what I'm going to say to you countless times... But of course, now that it's time to say it, I'm feeling shy. Terribly shy...",
        "You... You what?! Oh goodness! You really mean it!",
        "Oh! I...",
        "I'm sorry! Why am I crying when I'm so happy? I've been so worried about this! I was thinking of what I'd do if...if...if you said no! But then...you asked me! I didn't even have to ask you! I'm just so relieved!",

        "Oh, I'm just going for my morning walk. Hey, maybe you'd like to join me. It's a great way to start the day!",
        "I hear that a lot. Father was always busy with work, so he wasn't around much. But when he was home, he'd often take me with him for his walks.",
        "I'll admit, it was a bit lonely growing up...but I understand. Father loved his work. No one ever doubted that. Actually...I've been thinking recently that I'd like to talk to you more, Your Highness.",
        "Father was a man of few words, both with myself and my mother. But sometimes he would tell me about you. So...you don't really feel like a stranger to me. In a way, it's like I've known you for a long time... Almost as though you're my big brother.",
        "Oh! Uh... I'm so sorry. I don't know why I let that slip out. That was rude of me.",
        "Do you really want to know? Well, for one, he used to tell this story about when you were a child and...",
        "Your Highness! I have a little favor to ask of you.",
        "Well, I was hoping you could...tell me about my father. I imagine he was a very different man at home than he was at work.",
        "That doesn't surprise me. He was much the same at home. He'd chide us if we made mistakes, whether it was with cooking or even how we spoke.",
        "Wait... Are you saying that's not how he was around you?",
        "Hehe, I can hardly imagine that! He was completely different with me.",
        "Really? What would he say about me?",
        "No, stop! It's probably too embarrassing to bear... Is it?",
        "Look, I'll promise to forget the stories he told me about you, if you return the favor. Deal?",
        "Your Highness! I have one more favor to ask...",
        "Um, it's not about Father this time. This time, I wanted to ask about you.",
        "I mean, I heard all about Father last time. But I didn't ask about you.",
        "Oh, it doesn't have to be funny or interesting! That's not why I'm asking. It's just that I thought I already knew you, but I'm not sure I really do... That day when we were reunited at the monastery... I didn't know what to say to you. So I wanted to prepare some of your favorite food. I thought maybe if you ate something that you liked, you'd cheer up a little. But when I got to the kitchen, I realized I didn't even know what you like to eat.",
        "Yes, that's right. I'm at my happiest when I'm digging into a sweet treat. Oh! Did you know there's a famous sweets shop in the capital?",
        "The sweets were so good... They cost a fortune, but I loved them. When Father was still around, we all lived as a family in the capital. Since then, I've had them only a few times. Ahh... How I'd love to taste them again.",
        "That's right... But five years ago, my uncle betrayed the Kingdom and went over to the Empire's side. I reconnected with Father. So I'd like to live with my family again, in the capital. Also, if I'm in the capital, I'll be able to see you from time to time... Right?",
        "Father's at a ripe old age now. I'd appreciate it if you didn't work him too hard!",
        "Your Highness! Thank you for everything.",
        "Oh, no, it's not that. I just had the chance to return to the capital on military business. It had really been a long time. Life's pretty hard there right now, but its old vitality seems to be returning, bit by bit. If it wasn't for you, I'm sure things wouldn't be looking so promising. So...",
        "You had no choice! If you had remained in the capital, you would have been killed. If you keep thinking so dark and gloomy, you're going to end up looking just like Father.",
        "You really are a lot more like Father than I am. Before Father left us, he used to say similar things. I don't want you to end up like him, so I've been thinking... When this war is over, I was wondering whether I could help you with your work. Of course, I don't know how much I'd be able to support a king...",
        "If I leave you to your own devices, you'll forget how to laugh! We can't have that. You won't be able to do what you have to do with such a miserable look on your face. So, if you'll have me, I'd like to stay by your side. If you're sad or suffering, I'll just starve you until you muster a smile!",
        "Hey! You weren't supposed to laugh at that part! I thought a lot about this!",
        "Yes! I promise!",

        "Yes, that's right.",
        "Soul stirring? My creepity creep song? I think that's a bit of an exaggeration...",
        "Scream? Like a beast? That's not what I was doing. And...and what's this weird ritual you're talking about?",
        "Deep meaning? No... Just... No.",
        "Work what out?",
        "Ah, no, it's fine. Really.",
        "He is not gonna let this go, is he...",
        "Sure, but I'm finished eating. You're here late. Busy day?",
        "So you didn't manage to forget about that. I really wish you would.",
        "The cry...of a poor soul?",
        "Eh...",
        "What? No! You're not even close! It wasn't supposed to be a dark and miserable song at all.",
        "The lyrics are simply about seeds pushing out of the ground to become sweet, little buds. They creep through the dirt until they find the light! The song just describes what it's like to be a budding flower.",
        "Do you...think it's embarrassing that I made up such a silly song?",
        "Oh, of course! Let's see here... ♪ Walking the purpose and a steady stride... Lively and bright and full of pride... Crying, laughing, and blazing ahead... Why worry 'bout tomorrow? Let's eat instead... ♪ So, uh... What would you say this song is about, Claude?",
        "Hey, Claude! I think I've worked out what your lyrics mean! Care to hear me out?",
        "I did! You were writing about yourself, right? About how you just keep moving forward, no matter what difficulties you encounter. We've got this, we did it, now let's eat. That kind of thing. Am I right?",
        "It's about...me?!",
        "Haha, I see! I'm flattered...I think? Actually, I can't really tell if you're saying something nice or not...",
        "Boisterous... That's definitely not a compliment. Still... Thank you, Claude. I'm really pleased that you thought so hard about me and wrote a neat song like that. You know, what this song really needs is a nice little dance to go with it...",
        "Nope! Not happening! I'm afraid my dances are not for public consumption. It will have to suffice that I let you see it.",
        "I suppose there are a few others I could maybe share. Like my bear song! Or my dungeon song! Ooh! Or the waltz of the swamp beasties!",
        "Oh, they're all just silly songs... I don't know that they're anything worth being excited about.",
        "Well! I guess I have no choice. I'm making an exception just for you, Claude.",
        "Phew... I guess taking them all up in one go was a bad idea...",
        "Linhardt! Hi! I'm so glad you're here!",
        "I don't know if I'll be able to handle all these...",
        "I thought I may as well get it over with, so I decided to carry them all at once. Big mistake.",
        "But maybe you could help! Nope. Gone. Gah. It is fine. Just a little further to my quarters. I've got this. I'll just... Just... Gaah! Huh? They didn't fall...",
        "Linhardt! I thought you had an important nap to get to.",
        "Thanks. Though it may have been best if you had just chipped in from the start...",
        "Then why help me at all?",
        "Huh. But if you had helped me from the start, there would have been no danger of anything being dropped at all.",
        "After all that, he's still not going to help me.",
        "Linhardt, wake up!",
        "Morning is long gone.",
        "No. You. Can. Not. Get up this instant!",
        "Oh? What were you dreaming about?",
        "I thought as much. I have to ask. I'm pretty sure you could do anything you put your mind to, so why do you spend so much of your life sleeping?",
        "No one can be that tired all the time.",
        "Are you kidding me? No one sleeps for two days. That's beyond lazy. That's... There's not even a word for that!",
        "After I did you the favor of waking you up, you could at least take this seriously. Look, putting in effort is how you grow. You know, as a person and stuff.",
        "Linhardt! I wasn't finished talking!",
        "Ahh, there's nothing like a morning stroll to take in some fresh air! Hm? In the thicket there. Is that...a human foot? Eeek! It moved! Someone, help!",
        "Hey! You shouldn't surprise people like that! I thought you were an undead corpse... Why are you sleeping out here anyway? We're in the middle of a war! Doesn't that seem dangerous?",
        "Stop joking around! What are you even talking about?",
        "You really never change, do you? You sleep as much as ever... Do you even remember what I told you?",
        "Of course you don't. I told you that putting in effort...",
        "So...you do remember?",
        "No! Ugh. It's just...you should put your talents to use elsewhere, that's all.",
        "No, that's not... OK, let me put it this way instead. Working hard for other people helps you grow as a person. Do you not get the urge to work hard for other people, like when you helped me before?",
        "Um, for the gain I mentioned...that it helps you grow as a person.",
        "Just for me?",
        "Oh! What do you mean by that?!",
        "If we're doing our best for each other and all, then that's a bit like...just kind of like...like a marriage!",
        "Hmph! As though I would marry a man who can't even get up in the morning!",
        "That was my worst mistake yet. Why am I so clumsy all the time?! The women laughed and forgave me, but... How am I supposed to face them now?",
        "Don't tease me like that, Caspar! Can't you see I'm down?",
        "You might be right about that... Are you sure you don't mind?",
        "Well... Today they were short on staff in the dining hall, so I offered to help out... But I sort of...messed up—big.",
        "All the plates in the kitchen went flying through the air. And the pots started giving off this weird blue steam.",
        "The people in the dining hall saw the chaos and started panicking, and then soldiers came running... Finally, Catherine appeared and shut everyone up with a slash of Thunderbrand. All I was trying to do was help out. But in the end, I just ended up making more work for everyone. I'm awful like that.",
        "I know. The women at the dining hall laughed and forgave me. But...",
        "Well, no. But...",
        "You know what? You're right! I guess all I can do is try harder next time. Thanks, Caspar. That really did help me feel better. I can't keep moping around! I've got to work on my cooking skills! And I can count on you to be my taste tester, right? Right!",
        "Why did this have to happen... Getting separated from my own troop... I'm a failure as a commander... It's already almost sunset... My wounds are aching... And I'm so hungry... Maybe I'm just going to die right here... Oh, but no! That's such a pathetic way to die... I wonder if the rest of my soldiers are OK... I'm so worried about them...",
        "Caspar? What are you doing here? I was wounded in the forest... lost sight of my troop... I wandered around and... oh! Where is everyone?!",
        "Oh, I'm all right... Though I might have trouble running...",
        "No, that's not it. I was just thinking about what a hopeless commander I am... It's my job to look after my soldiers, but they ended up having to look out for me... If I'm this hopeless, I shouldn't be out there at all...",
        "Caspar..",
        "Yes... You're right! Thank you, Caspar.",
        "Hey, Caspar. Can I ask you something?",
        "Is there anything you pay particular attention to on the battlefield? Stuff you make sure not to mess up? I don't want to make any major mistakes again... So I've been thinking about how I can improve. But it's trickier than I thought! I was hoping you could give me some direction.",
        "Huh? Really? Nothing at all?",
        "Hm. I guess that does sound like something you'd say. But I'm not sure how much use it is to me.",
        "Well, yes. People's lives are on the line! If I mess up, they might actually die! When I think that my failures might put everyone in danger, I...",
        "So what you're saying is, I should stop being afraid of failure, and just try my hardest on the battlefield, like I do in training...",
        "That really is just like you, Caspar. I'm starting to feel stupid for worrying so much. You're so strong and confident. I really like that about you!",
        "OK, I'm going to try following your example from now on! It's time I stopped moping around here and put everything I've got into training! Right, Caspar?!",
        "Yeah!",
        "'''' Agh! No!",
        "Oh no-oh no-oh no! Please tell me that wasn't the pan...",
        "Dedue! Well, as you can see...the pan kind of...exploded. Just a little.",
        "I looked away for a moment and the pan just went BOOM! Ugh, I'm grateful nothing caught fire, but now the kitchen is a mess.",
        "Oh, no. I just got a little spooked. Heh, I really lucked out, didn't I? That could have turned out much worse.",
        "Right. Sorry. I'll be more careful from now on.",
        "Huh?",
        "No! I can't let you do that! This is all my fault. You shouldn't have to help me.",
        "Oh, you're right. So, after we clean up, you're also gonna...help me cook?",
        "Of course not! I'm just so sorry to bother you with this.",
        "Hi, Dedue! I wanted to thank you again for helping me out the other day. Everything was ready in time for dinner, and we all agreed the food was really tasty!",
        "That's silly talk! With just a few ingredients, you made an amazing meal! I could never have done it, no way. You deserve all the praise in the world!",
        "Well, if that's your aim, you're in luck! I've seen him shovel in your food with gusto. You must be really ambitious if you're not satisfied with that meal. I'd love for you to teach me your ways. I want to be a great cook too!",
        "Well, sure...I know that. But how can I stop making those errors? No matter how hard I try, I always seem to mess things up. The pan explodes when I cook. I forget my purse when I go shopping. That's just how life is for a scatterbrain like me. Just the other day I was nearly laughed off the training ground for wearing mismatched shoes! My uncle used to sigh in despair when he saw me messing something up.",
        "That's all great advice. Thank you, Dedue! You really have a kind heart. At first I thought you were so stern all the time.",
        "Uh. Well. A bit? Maybe if you smiled sometimes. All you have to do is lift up the corners of your mouth, like this. See?",
        "No! I can't let you do that! This is all my fault. You shouldn't have to help me.",
        "Hehe, it's fine! Honestly, it's pretty funny when you think about it.",
        "No kidding! And I didn't expect the two of us to get covered in hay!",
        "Don't be ridiculous! And especially don't be sad. It's no trouble at all, I promise. Everyone makes mistakes. Isn't that what you've been trying to teach me?",
        "It does look like this will take a while to clean up. But if we work together, it'll be done in no time!",
        "Don't apologize. When it's your turn for stable duty, I'm happy to help.",
        "Sure! And in return, you can help me out when I'm on kitchen duty.",
        "By the way, I tried out all that stuff you mentioned before. About how not to be a scatterbrain. I'm still pretty hopeless, but thanks to you, I'm making fewer mistakes. It's probably not a good idea for me to be left alone around knives and boiling water though. That's why it'll be nice knowing you have my back!",
        "Huh?",
        "Agh! I'm sorry! So sorry!",
        "I completely forgot that it's my turn for kitchen duty today! Huh? Dedue... Did you do all the kitchen prep already?",
        "What? But... Did I get the day wrong?",
        "Oh! Haha, I'm so sorry! Wow, I really am something else...",
        "Hahaha!",
        "Oh, no. I was just happy. You see... My uncle is really strict. He wanted me to be perfect at cooking, studying, cooking, washing...everything, really. He said if I wasn't perfect, as a knight's daughter, I'd be devaluing my Crest. Whenever I messed up he'd look so mad... And he'd sigh, like he'd just lost his faith in humanity.",
        "Oh, I know he loved me and all... He was just kind of scary. But you've helped me out and been patient with me without getting mad. I'm just so happy! Thank you, Dedue.",
        "You know what? You remind me of my father. You look scary at first glance, but you're actually really kind!",
        "Oh, right! Let me help you with something, if that's OK with you! What are you cooking today? Hopefully, I can chip in...",
        "Uh... I'm still a complete klutz, so I'm not going to be in the way, am I?",
        "Oh, wow. That's...",
        "Haha, well then! I can't wait for dinnertime!",
        "♪ Today's dinner is steak and then a cake that's yummy yum... Now it's time to fill my tummy tummy tum... ♪ ♪ Oh, this mountain of sweets, and treats that I long to eats... Oh, stacks of steaks and cakes and crumbs and yums... ♪",
        "Felix! You weren't listening, were you?",
        "No! I mean... Well, yes. At least tell me you didn't see the dance?",
        "YOU'RE EVIL, FELIX!",
        "You can't just spy on people while they're singing without even saying anything! It's not right!",
        "Well... You need to speak louder, then! Ugh, this is so embarrassing... And of course I was singing some silly food song I made up. I should have been singing about... bears! Or swamp beasties!",
        "Oh, you are the worst!",
        "Hello, Felix. So, uh, it was your turn to clean out the greenhouse, right?",
        "Well, I went ahead and took care of it. I also cleaned up the warehouse.",
        "I just wanted to...help you out...so that... OK, fine! I'm bribing you. So you'll forget!",
        "Are you really going to make me say it? Before! In the greenhouse. I want you to forget what you saw and heard. If you agree to forget about it, I'll take your shift in the stables. Do we have a deal?",
        "No?! But that's not OK! You have to forget about it! Right this moment!",
        "Stop it, Felix! You're a villain!",
        "You think you're so funny? Keeping a straight face while mocking my singing and dancing! Well, you have to forget about it. Please! What if I make you a nice steak dinner? You like steak, don't you, Felix? It will be yummy.",
        "Fine, be stubborn! Tell the whole world for all I care! I'll just learn to live with the funny looks I'll get from everyone. They'll all say, \"There goes that Annette, the girl with the funny ideas about food!\" You're just the evilest of villains, Felix! I'll hate you forever and ever!",
        "♪ Oh, how I just love to clean. Clean the library room! Just takes a flash of light and then it all goes boom! ♪ ♪ A flash and then a big boom! ♪",
        "♪ A flash and then a big– ♪ Bah! What are you doing here, Felix?",
        "You were watching me again, weren't you?!",
        "Oh, today of all days! I knew I should've chosen a different song...",
        "Any of them! The box song! Or maybe the dungeon song!",
        "No, they're just regular songs! Oh, forget it. While you're here, can you help me clean up? I need the books on that shelf up there, but I can't reach them...",
        "No way! It's too embarrassing! And that song isn't even finished, anyway.",
        "Hey... Don't look at me like that! OK, fine. If you insist, I'll sing just a bit more... ♪ Oh, how I just love to clean. Clean the library room! Just takes a flash of light and then it all goes boom! ♪",
        "♪ A flash and then a big boom, suddenly the deed is done! My! What a great job I did! Who says cleaning isn't fun? ♪",
        "Ugh, this is so embarrassing...",
        "Phew! Now the flowers are all taken care of! Huh, Felix... Why are you hiding there?",
        "No? Then what are you here for? You don't even have a real reason, do you?",
        "Then why...",
        "What? What's that supposed to mean?",
        "My captive! What are you saying? Oh my, I'm suddenly really flustered...",
        "Felix! Are you...blushing?",
        "Um...",
        "Well! If you feel like that about it... I suppose I could sing for you sometimes. If you'd like that sort of thing.",
        "Hey, wait! You just got here... Do you want to hear me sing or not?",
        "Well, what song do you want me to sing? Bears, swamp beasties, boxes, or dungeons?",
        "Well... OK. Just this once...",
        "Oh! Ashe. Are you here to study too?",
        "It really is. Hey, would you like to study together? We can help each other out if we get stuck.",
        "What's the matter, Ashe?",
        "Hmm... It may help to focus on maximizing target accuracy to reduce your miss rate. To start, let's sort out the setup. Let's see...using the ballista specifications... If the ballista quarrels follow this trajectory, they'll hit the enemy lines, right?",
        "That's it! OK, now try using that same technique and applying it to this other problem.",
        "I knew you'd get it.",
        "That's true. But not everyone is good with numbers. That's why we have tacticians to do these calculations for us, or prepare them before we go to battle. A century ago, the Empire's mathematicians played a huge role in the Battle of the Wall of Fódlan.",
        "You think so?",
        "I suppose I have! Studying is a necessity if you want the advantage over your enemies. But necessity aside, it's nice to hear you say that.",
        "OK, now that you know the technique, go ahead and solve this problem.",
        "See? Isn't it fun to learn?",
        "Well, studying was something of a necessity for me.",
        "My father was one of the king's knights. One day, he never returned home. He just left without ever saying a word to me or my mother.",
        "After he left, I thought a lot about where he might have gone. My father was a devout believer, so I was certain he must have come here to Garreg Mach.",
        "That's why I was determined to gain acceptance into the academy. I needed to come here so I could search for my father. The problem was that I needed money to get in. Lots of it. And I didn't have any at all. So I entered the school of sorcery in Fhirdiad first, hoping I could somehow find a path here. I studied tirelessly until I finally earned myself a recommendation.",
        "Destiny, huh? Well, yes, but it's a bit embarrassing when you put it like that. Now I have other reasons for wanting to keep trying hard. I want to protect all of my friends and allies here. I'm studying hard so I can be as useful as possible to everyone I hold dear.",
        "Aww... How unlucky that we were assigned to clean this ancient tower...",
        "With all the windows boarded up, it's so dark. And there are strange noises... Like that noise! What was that? A rat?! Tell me it was a rat...",
        "You're not scared of ghosts, are you, Ashe? I didn't think you'd be...",
        "Ahhh! Oh no! What was that noise?",
        "What?! You mean we're trapped in here?",
        "Don't worry about that now! We need to think of a way out of here!",
        "Yes, that! We can do it in no time.",
        "Calm down, Ashe! It's a cobweb! Just a cobweb! We've got to pull ourselves together. Now, which of the windows should we check? Ah, I can't stand it here in the pitch dark!",
        "I wouldn't want to go through that again... For a moment there, I didn't think we'd make it out alive. No... Wait! I've lost it. It's gone!",
        "The doll my father gave me... I must have dropped it.",
        "No! It's OK... Don't worry about it. I've been meaning to throw it out for a while now.",
        "Yes, but it can't be helped. Let's just get back to the monastery...",
        "The doll from my father must be in this tower. But I'm too scared to go looking for it...",
        "Ashe! What are you doing here?",
        "My doll! You went back for it? But why?",
        "Ashe... Thank you! I'm so happy! To be honest, I didn't have the courage to go back in there to get it myself. But thanks to you, I didn't have to. And you're afraid of ghosts, right? Were you OK in there all by yourself?",
        "Oh, poor Ashe! You're safe now, I promise.",
        "No, I don't think that at all. I think you're something special, Ashe! You were really brave. And all for me... That wasn't an easy thing to do. I'm in awe of you!",
        "Yes, I'll gladly attest to that! I'm sure you'll be a splendid knight! Maybe you'll even outdo my father!",
        "Sorry, Sylvain, but I'm trying to think right now. Could you keep quiet for a bit?",
        "If I use the formula in this line here, the magical energy should... No, that's not right...",
        "Sylvain, I'm serious! Please be quiet.",
        "I said be... Oh. You're right. How did you know that?",
        "Most people wouldn't be able to grasp this formula just by glancing at it. Have you read this book before?",
        "Hmm... And what's your take on this part here?",
        "You know...you're actually kind of amazing. I've been studying magic for a while now, but even I have trouble with this stuff. You act like all you do is mess around, but are you actually working hard in secret?",
        "That's easy for you to say. You're strong and smart without even trying. It's not fair.",
        "Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.",
        "What is wrong with you?",
        "Got lucky, huh? I'm not sure about that. Well, that does it. It might be tough, but I won't accept second place. Let's go, me! I can do this! I'm going to finish this whole book before sundown!",
        "Sylvain! Good timing. There's something I want to say to you.",
        "No! I'm not here to get after you about those things. Surely other people have that covered. What I really want to talk about is your behavior during our training sessions. When we're sparring, you're always passing on great opportunities to get the edge on me. It's almost as though you're going out of your way to make me think you're incapable!",
        "Uh-huh. It's not that you took something I said to heart? About how you don't have to work hard to be good at stuff and how that isn't fair?",
        "Oh. Is that...sincerity? It's kind of creeping me out. It's just so unlike you!",
        "When you say nice things like that, I can't take joy in beating you! I want to beat you when you're at your best! That's why it bothers me so much when you don't try your hardest against me.",
        "I have to admit, I have a hard time understanding where you're coming from. Just know that...I want you to keep being great at things without trying. If you stop being that way, I won't have any competition!",
        "Sure thing! The very next moment I'm free. For now, I need to get to my magic training.",
        "That shopping trip took longer than expected, didn't it, Mercie?",
        "Hehe, you're so good at deciding the best thing to buy. I sort of wanted it all! I mean, not that I was excessive. I think you bought just about as much as I did.",
        "What?! That's... Oh, fine. You got me. I was just having too much fun! I love shopping with you, Mercie.",
        "Isn't it? And I'm pretty confident the professor will forgive us for our little detour. This actually reminds me of going to school in Fhirdiad.",
        "So much has changed since then. Oh, but there's at least one thing that hasn't changed.",
        "That's just what I was about to say!",
        "Mercie, we'll stay friends like this forever... Won't we?",
        "Since our time in the capital, so much has happened. We've had to make new lives for ourselves, and we've seen at least as many hard times as good. If things keep changing like this, I wonder if we'll be able to stay the same people we are now...",
        "We'll figure it out together. Right?",
        "Oh, Mercie. I can always guess what you're going to say.",
        "You're right. Run, Mercie!",
        "Run! Haha!",
        "OK, Mercie. This time we're gonna be really good and get the supplies with no detours.",
        "Hey, that's not fair! I want to browse too!",
        "I've never seen this person before. I'm sorry to be rude, but we're kind of busy.",
        "Step back, Mercie. This could get dangerous. Listen here, you! There's no way you can win against me. I don't want to fight you, but I will if I have to. So just...back away!",
        "This is far enough. We should be safe.",
        "I just... I thought you were in danger, Mercie!",
        "Mercie! I was just trying to protect you...",
        "Is this about what happened when we were shopping? If so, it's fine. Don't worry about it.",
        "Mercie...",
        "Mercie, you're upsetting me! How dare you say that you drag me down! You know why I was acting so recklessly? Because I wanted to protect my best friend in the whole world!",
        "Do you remember when we first enrolled at the academy? It seemed like everyone was leagues ahead of us and so far out of reach. I felt completely hopeless... But because you were there, I didn't lose hope. So... Don't say stupid things about how you drag me down or how you don't deserve things!",
        "Mercie, can we be friends again?",
        "Good! I don't know what I would have done if we hadn't found a way to make up.",
        "No, I'm the one who should have stopped being so stubborn and said something. You know, now that everything's as it should be, I'm suddenly starving!",
        "Ooh, let's! And we should have some Mercie-baked sweets on the side! I think I love you more than just about anything in the world!",
        "Not as sweet as your baking! I love your baking more than anything in the world too, other than you.",
        "I'm so happy to have you bake—uh, back!",
        "Hello, Ingrid. Can I have just a teeny tiny moment of your time?",
        "I was wondering... Do you have any interest in fashion and makeup and stuff like that?",
        "Oh, but you're missing out on something so fun! I mean, it's not like you need it, of course. You've got beautiful bone structure, lovely hair, long legs... But aren't you interested in trying something new?",
        "Sure, but imagine if you could combine the two and become the most fabulous knight ever! OK, maybe I'm taking it too far. I know knights don't necessarily need a ton of make-up or things like that for the job. I'm just saying I really think you'd enjoy it if you opened your mind to it. All I'm talking about is a light touch. I can see it now... Your gorgeous face done up with a delicate application of makeup. The fabulous knight who everyone looks up to and wants to be!",
        "Hooray! OK, we don't have a moment to lose. Here, take this makeup kit. Play around with the colors and see what speaks to you.",
        "I actually got that little kit as a gift the other day, and I wasn't sure what to do with it, because I already have that one. It's a limited palette, but I think it fits the look you're going for perfectly.",
        "What? Oh... Well then I guess this whole kit will have to go to waste. I'll just throw it away like the garbage it is.",
        "That's the spirit! Oh, and I'm happy to help you learn to apply it too. Come on, let's go to my room. I have some brush techniques to show you before you get started.",
        "Ingrid...",
        "I'm just so sorry. I had no idea!",
        "Well, I was really curious about why you're not interested in things like makeup. So I asked some of our friends about it...and...",
        "They did. I'm so sorry. It was so thoughtless of me to try pushing those things on you.",
        "Oh. So you just...never sought that stuff out?",
        "Me? Oh, I didn't do anything at all. Except pester.",
        "Yes! It's very subtle, but I could tell right away that you were using that makeup that I gave you!",
        "You did great, and it really suits you.",
        "It's my pleasure. Oh, this is so great! Want to go shopping to celebrate?",
        "There's a dress I've been eyeing for a while now. I'm certain it will complement your pretty eyes. Just leave it to me, Ingrid. I'll make you the most fabulous knight this world has ever seen!",
        "Hi hi, Lysithea! When are you going to teach me magic? Is now good?",
        "Why? Because you're way better at it than me, silly!",
        "Well, sure... But I wouldn't say I've got any kind of natural talent for it. I'm going to have to try very hard to become as good of a mage as you are!",
        "No! I wasn't saying that at all! Everyone knows how hard you work. I just meant that if I want to be as good as you, I'll have to work really, incredibly hard!",
        "Oh! So you'll teach me? Thank you so much! Um, actually...",
        "Oh, I get it now! I never thought about it that way before!",
        "Don't be silly. You're just that good of a teacher! Your way of looking at the world is so fundamentally different from mine",
        "Oh no, I'm sorry! I wasn't doing that! There I go, saying the wrong thing again.",
        "Huh?",
        "Oh, I'm sorry to take up your time! Thanks again for teaching me!",
        "Lysithea! Hi! Did you forget something?",
        "Just something I found. Though there are things in here I don't quite get.",
        "It is! Amazing how you could tell that just from a glance at the cover.",
        "Wait, really? Yikes! Thanks for the warning.",
        "No, not as much as some people. I'm... Oh! Sorry. There I go again.",
        "Oh no! But then I'll have to work extra, extra hard to keep up with you!",
        "Aw, come on! Fine. Super duper quadruple extra hard it is!",
        "Heh, sorry. It's fun to see you get carried away like that though.",
        "I feel the same. I'll do my best to keep pace with you!",
        "Oh, it's nothing. I was just thinking about how nice it is that we can motivate each other like this.",
        "Nuh-uh! I'm gonna surpass you! But before that... Uh, could you explain this part of the book to me?",
        "Hilda! I'm coming in!",
        "Haha! Oh, wow. It really is messy. I'm not sure there's even enough room to breathe.",
        "Oh... Hey, how about I clean up for you?",
        "I love it! Actually, the messier a room is, the more determined I get to conquer the crud!",
        "Great! See you later!",
        "Awaaaah!",
        "Oh my goodness! I'm so, so sorry! I'll clean it up right— Ahhh!",
        "Th-there was a big bug! So big...",
        "I'm so terribly sorry, Hilda. I wanted to clean up for you, but I basically did the opposite...",
        "I guess that's one way to think of it...",
        "Don't worry about me! I'm fine! I've been like this my whole life. I've never wanted to let anyone down. My parents, my uncle... So I always try to give it my all. And it's taken me this far, at least!",
        "Ooh, you're keeping your room really tidy these days, Hilda!",
        "Heh, I'm sorry again about that. And about all of the other things I knocked over too...",
        "Ah! I'm sorry! I said I'm sorry! I put everything back, didn't I?!",
        "Huh? That was a quick change of subject!",
        "Hmm... You might be right. It could be nice to do something for myself sometime. But if I hadn't tried hard for other people's sakes, maybe I wouldn't have tried at all. I might not have made it this far. So really, I don't regret a thing. Who I am now is the sum of everything I've done.",
        "You really think so?",
        "A nap? But I'm not done with my chores...",
        "Are you sure it's OK to nap right now? I still have stuff to do for the professor...",
        "Oh, fine. Just for a bit. The sunlight coming through the window is awfully nice...",
        "Mmhmm. It really is... relaxing...",
        "Zzz Zzz Zzz",
        "I did! Thank you very much! Oh, but I was also wondering about this part here... It seems a bit off.",
        "Wonderful! I can't wait!",
        "None! Thank you so much! Ah, I feel so great. I'm really sorry for taking up so much of your time though...",
        "Really? That's so nice of you to say! I'll do my best! I'm honored to be your student.",
        "I won't, thank you! Good-bye for now!",
        "Ahh! I'm sorry! Thank you!",
        "Don't worry about it. It's the least I can do to repay you for all you've taught me. It seems like a small payment, honestly. I wish I could do more!",
        "The bookshelf? But it's not even dusty...",
        "Oh, OK! Leave it to me! Whoa! There are a lot of rare books here...",
        "Huh? Whoa!",
        "Yes... I'm fine... Sorry...",
        "So dirt was lurking in the places we couldn't see, just like you said!",
        "This dirt is really bothersome...",
        "You can count on me!",
        "Hm. There's a lot of dust here... It looks like nobody's cleaned it in ages. Oh, I can't just leave it! It must be cleaned! Urgh... Gah... Ohh! Can't...quite...reach... Just a little...further... If only...I was...taller...",
        "Professor Hanneman! Phew! Thank you so much! There was just so much dust up there...",
        "OK! Thank you!",
        "I just couldn't rest easy thinking that we hadn't finished cleaning in here.",
        "You and I are like two peas in a pod! Oh, I'm sorry. That's a bit rude of me...",
        "Yes?",
        "That's very kind, but I wouldn't want to bother someone as busy as you!",
        "Oh gosh, I'm so sorry about that... Right. Next time, I'll definitely call for you!",
        "I promise that won't happen! Most likely!",
        "I'm so sorry for always taking up your time, Professor Hanneman...",
        "Hm? Oh, uh... nothing in particular.",
        "You see right through me, Professor Hanneman. OK. Here goes. The truth is... I've been wondering what I'll do when the war finally comes to an end.",
        "You've hit the nail on the head. There's so much I want to do, I feel completely lost...",
        "You think so?",
        "But where will you go?",
        "You don't mean me, do you?!",
        "I have considered that it might be nice to be a professor like you... But I'm such a scatterbrain! And I make mistakes all the time, so I'm not confident I can manage...",
        "Do you really think so? Maybe I can do it after all...",
        "I feel like, with your guidance, I could excel anywhere!",
        "That's true! I'm going to try my hardest to make sure that happens!",
        "Father! Father! Why do you pretend not to recognize me?!",
        "I've been looking everywhere for you. Please stop treating me like a stranger. I can't bear it!",
        "Father, wait! How long will you keep avoiding me like this?!",
        "This has nothing to do with rights! We're family, I'm your daughter.",
        "You really think it was foolish to abandon us?",
        "Then the least you can do is apologize. I'm fine, but Mother deserves as much. I've finished my studies at the school of sorcery and entered the Officers Academy. I have a busy and satisfying life now. But Mother... She's waited for you to return all this time, living under my uncle's roof.",
        "I already told you. Don't say that to me. Apologize to Mother! Let her see your face!",
        "Father... How could you be so cruel...",
        "What's wrong, Father? I didn't expect you to summon me...",
        "A wooden doll... You used to make these for me when I was a child.",
        "It's so cute! It's...wait. No. What do you want from me?",
        "I was back then, but I'm not a child anymore. It's too late for this now, Father. It doesn't make me happy anymore.",
        "I... I was so lonely after you left. I was always, always alone. I didn't know where you were, or who to turn to for comfort. All I could do was look at the dolls you carved for me, and remember you...and weep!",
        "Father, wait! No, this won't do at all. It would be better to throw this doll away.",
        "You are too cruel, Father. Of course I... I could never throw it away...",
        "Praying, Father?",
        "You keep saying it's your fault, Father, but you're wrong. His Highness doesn't blame you. Neither does King Lambert, I'm sure of it. But... I guess that's not the issue for you, is it?",
        "That's obvious from looking at you, Father. I think Mother understood it as well. But before fleeing the country, I wish you had thought about your family, if only for a moment. Even if the whole world had condemned you, we would always have been your allies...",
        "No, I told you before. I don't particularly want you to apologize.",
        "Yes, Father?",
        "A bundle of letters... There are so many...",
        "Father! Oh, for the love of... He's done it again! But what have we here... Hm, just as I thought. Letters for me and Mother. And so many... But why, and how? I suppose I'll have to read them if I hope to find my answers.",
        "Hello, Father. May I have a moment?",
        "I...I read all your letters. You never stopped writing them, did you?",
        "My birthday. Mother's birthday. Every possible occasion, without fail...",
        "So why didn't you send any of them? If you had sent even one, we would have...",
        "I would always talk about it with Mother... If only he'd write us, at least one, we'd say. We waited and waited...all those long years.",
        "I'm tired of hearing it, so just stop. Your apologies change nothing! Send those letters to Mother. She'll be happy to hear from you.",
        "In that case, why don't I send them?",
        "All right then, I'll send them. You don't get to take it back afterwards. Father... You should know that they made me happy.",
        "Knowing that you were thinking of us all along. We were worried about you, Mother and I. Neither of us ever came out and said it, but... We thought maybe you hated us, were trying to forget all about us...",
        "I see. All right...then swear. Swear that some day, when this war is over, you'll come back to us.",
        "No matter what. That's a promise you just made. If you break it, I'll never speak to you again.",
        "Great! Now I'm positively elated! I can't wait until we're all a family again!"

        "Phew—shopping took longer than I thought. It's a good thing I had your help, Professor! Looks like we've got everything we came for. Time to head back to the monastery. To tell you the truth, I wasn't sure if the money that knight gave us would be enough. We managed to scrape by though! I'm glad those shopkeepers were willing to strike a few bargains.",
        "It's one of the few things I'm really good at. I've got a lot of experience living in the city. Money was tight for me too. At least until a kind noble adopted me into his family. Come to think of it, you were originally a mercenary, weren't you? I'm sure you've traveled all over Fódlan. That must have been a pretty different life from regular folks like me.",
        "But a mercenary's whole job is fighting, isn't it? Must be a pretty tough way to live.",

        "Please... Calm down, ma'am.",
        "Here, allow me to compensate you.",
        "Don't you worry. That thief will be paying me back, just as soon as I catch him. Head on back to the monastery, Professor. I'll take care of everything here!",
        "Hey, Professor! Did I ever tell you what happened with that thief?",
        "I went after him, and I did manage to catch up, but...",
        "My pockets were pretty empty after that incident, if you want to know the truth. What happened was, when I caught him, I asked him why he stole the book. He said he thought it would fetch a good price, and that he really needed the money. He had a sick kid, and couldn't pay for medicine.",
        "Maybe you're right. But if he really did have a sick child, that would be a matter of life and death. A little money is nothing compared to that. I'd rather believe a lie than risk someone's life if I'm wrong. And to be completely honest, there was a time when I wasn't so different from him.",
        "It was a long time ago, and I've put all that behind me now, but yes. I was. My parents died of illness, so I had to provide for my little brother and sister. I did my best to earn money for them legitimately, but I wasn't able to bring enough home. So I turned to thieving. From people on the streets. From shops. Even from soldiers. I knew it was wrong, but seeing my brother and sister's smiling faces made me too happy to stop.",
        "I really regret that part of my life. I was stupid. But shortly after I turned nine, I crept into a local noble's mansion, aiming to steal whatever I could get my hands on. The noble had all sorts of valuables, but what really caught my eye was a book with a fancy cover. That book was Loog and the Maiden of Wind. The knight in the illustrations was so impressive, I just couldn't tear my eyes away.",
        "You probably see where this is going. Moments after I grabbed the book, I was caught in the act by the noble. And that noble was none other than Lonato. But Lonato was incredibly kind. Without asking any questions, he gave me the book—and money too. When I told him I couldn't read, he invited me into his mansion, along with my brother and sister. He taught me how to read, personally. So with the thief I caught in town, I was trying to do the same thing. To be like Lonato. I want to make up for the bad things I've done. To leave this world better than I found it. That's why, even if it wasn't easy on my pockets, I'm proud to say I helped him.",
        "I know what you're trying to say. My contribution probably won't change much. And it's not like I have the money to help everyone who's suffering from poverty. Even so — I can't bear to stand by and do nothing. What else could I have done, Professor?",
        "Oh! Hey, Professor!",
        "Actually, I ran into that thief while I was shopping just now!",
        "Maybe you don't remember. It's been quite a while. The man who stole the book from that market stall. I saw him on the street with his kid. They were both so grateful. It's a really nice feeling.",
        "Yeah! But, ah... It did seem like they were still having trouble getting by. I guess what you said to me back then was right. My actions didn't really solve the problem. I can't help everyone, no matter how much I try.",
        "If I had the money or power, maybe... but I don't.",
        "You know, a long time ago, Lonato said nearly the same thing to me. I think it was when I tried to look after the horses all on my own. I really messed that up. He said, \"You're not quite ready for this yet. But there's no need to rush.\" I know I can't help very many people right now. But I think doing what I can for those I see in front of me is still worthwhile. I have to believe that, at least.",

        "You need all the rest you can get. It's only going to get more hectic from here. Even I'm tired, and I haven't done nearly as much. It's been a long struggle.",
        "So many people have died. And far too many of them were civilians. But with the state we're in now, it might actually be the survivors who have it hardest. I want to help them. Like Lonato helped me. And now that I'm a knight, I feel like I actually can.",
        "Definitely! When I'm by your side, I'm full of hope for the future. And on that note...there's something I've been meaning to give you.",
        "I want to be with you for the rest of my life. I want to be there for every important moment. Every smile. Every hardship. I know I'm just a commoner and nothing special. I know I don't have a Crest or a prestigious family legacy. And I've done things I'm not proud of. But if you'd be willing to look past all that...I also know we'd be great together.",
        "Yes! Sorry, I'm...I'm struggling for the right words. It's funny. I've rehearsed this so many times. But when the moment actually came, it all just ran right out of my head. What I mean to say is... I love you and I want to marry you.",
        "You have a ring for me too?! Am I dreaming? You really feel the same way about me... Sorry, I'm kind of giddy. This doesn't feel real. To go from a life of stealing on the streets, to marrying a wonderful person like you... Am I even allowed to be this happy? I'm worried it could all come crashing down at any moment.",
        "'''I'm looking forward to our future. I know I have my shortcomings, but I promise you I'll do everything I can to make you happy!'''",
        "Absolutely!",
        "No problem at all! I've had lots of practice with things like this. Happy to help however I can.",
        "Ah. Well, yes... Sorry, no! I can't ask you to do that!",
        "I can't have someone from the royal family running errands for me. It doesn't feel right.",
        "Lonato would be furious with me, I'm sure!",
        "I know. But to commoners like me, you're royalty. Regular folk normally only lay eyes on someone like you once or twice in their whole lives.",
        "What? No, that's not what I meant!",
        "Please, I promise I'll go myself just as soon as I've finished with the tent!",
        "Oh. Well, if price isn't a concern for you, then you should go for the sugar candies. The ones they make in town are really delightful. Ah! Oh, Your Highness—please, you mustn't!",
        "Your Highness! Please come back! I'm so sorry! I'll—I'll make sure these repairs get done!",
        "Your Highness—sorry, I mean, Dimitri—would you, um, do you want to train together today?",
        "Oh! Yes, I suppose— I mean, sure, it'd be— That is... It would be my pleasure to, ah—to dine? With you? I mean, I... Um...",
        "I'm sorry, Your Highness! I'm just no good at this! I'll do my best to improve!",
        "I'm trying to do as you asked, but it's just completely against my nature.",
        "That all makes sense, Your Highness. But I just can't bring myself to speak to you in such a casual way. Sure. When you get right down to it, royalty like you and commonfolk like me... We're all just people. But the commonfolk still rely on the nobility to keep the peace, and to keep them safe. Commoners pay the price for that in taxes and respect. That's what Lonato says.",
        "But that's not all there is to it!",
        "I also respect you as a person. You carry the weight of the whole Kingdom on your shoulders. You're a faultless warrior, and you're always so kind to your allies. Even me.",
        "Well, I...I do my best. So I guess...mutual respect between us is what's really the most appropriate.",
        "All right! Let's start from the beginning, then. Would you like to train with me today, Your Highness?",
        "I only just heard myself. Looks like a thief got into the pantry and made off with some of our food supply.",
        "Definitely! I'm sure we can capture the culprit if we work together.",
        "What?! I should be the one asking you that! The first thing we need to do once we've caught this person is hear what they have to say. They might have been forced into a life of theft by some awful circumstances.",
        "I'm all for the rule of law, but indiscriminate slaughter isn't going to solve anything. You can't just execute someone on a wild assumption and call it justice!",
        "Uh, what? How is fighting supposed to decide who's wrong and who's right? We're not barbarians, are we? Just take it easy and we can talk this over.",
        "H-hey! If they've already been caught, let's just leave it at that.",
        "Did you hear, Caspar? There's been another theft in the pantry!",
        "I've cut off his escape route! He's all yours!",
        "We did it. He was pretty nimble but no match for the two of us together!",
        "Yeah. I never would've guessed a cat this big could sneak into our pantry.",
        "We? Weren't you the one barreling on about striking the culprit down last time?",
        "Haha, I guess neither of us has the right solution here. So, what are we going to do with this — whoa!",
        "Huh?! Oh...",
        "Haha, looks like he gave us the slip!",
        "Well, after a daring escape like that, I guess there's no more we can do.",
        "I've got an idea of my own so, I guess I'd better find him first.",
        "Still hungry, huh? You're a greedy little fellow.",
        "Caspar! I-I was just... Hey, hang on a second... Did you come here to feed the cat too?",
        "I have been for a while. I had no idea you were doing the same.",
        "I didn't want him stealing more supplies, so I figured I'd take care of him. Guess we're not so different after all, are we?",
        "Since you're here, why don't you feed this little guy what you brought him?",
        "Looks like it... Hey, where did you get that?",
        "It looks awfully fresh. You didn't take that from the kitchen, did you?",
        "I, uh... Never mind how I got mine! What about yours?",
        "You started a fight over that?!",
        "Well, this cat's happy, so I'll let you off easy just this once. You're lucky he's so cute...",
        "Oh, is that Petra? Looks like she's out shopping.",
        "Petra! What are you doing!? Why are you fighting? Wh-what did she say?",
        "Huh? This has to be a misunderstanding. Look, I'll help you. What were you trying to buy?",
        "Got it. Just leave this to me. Come on, isn't that price a little high? Surely you can afford to go a bit lower.",
        "Really? Because the shop over by the gates is selling the same item for a little more than half that. Guess I'll have to head back there after all.",
        "Make it 20 percent and you've got a deal.",
        "Not a problem. I'm used to this sort of thing.",
        "Ah, I wouldn't call it a custom, exactly. It's just a trick we commoners use to save money.",
        "I promise you, it's really nothing special.",
        "Commoner techniques? Oh! You mean when I haggled for you.",
        "Really, it wasn't a big deal. But I'm glad the professor was pleased.",
        "Uh, what is it? Do I have something on my face?",
        "That's true. When you're surrounded by new people, you naturally pick up all kinds of stuff. Though with nobles, there's a lot to learn. All the etiquette is overwhelming. Not to mention the dancing. Ahh, I just keep stepping on my partner's feet!",
        "When I was a kid, I spent most of my time helping out at my parents' restaurant and playing with my brother and sister. Back then, I never dreamed I'd ever be studying at a proper academy with all these nobles.",
        "Secret skills? Haha, I don't think I know anything that fancy.",
        "I don't know about that. Really, I don't have any special secrets.",
        "What?! C-curses?! No, no, no, no, no! I-I don't need any dangerous information like that! But if you really insist, I guess I could teach you a few things about what life is like on the streets.",
        "Uh, that's not what I meant...",
        "Over here, Petra!",
        "That's all right. This is the place I was talking about. It's not much to look at, but the food's incredible!",
        "Mmm, looks great! Let's dig in!",
        "Um, I'm not sure if it has a name. They just kind of throw together whatever they've got. But that means you never eat the same dish twice. Not knowing what you'll get is part of the fun!",
        "No need to be so formal. I like showing you around. Not many people want to come to places like this.",
        "Hey, come on. Stop that.",
        "Talking about payment. You don't owe me anything. We're friends, aren't we? Friends don't pay each other for the time they spend together.",
        "I hope so, at least! So, why don't we just talk about whatever we'd like, OK?",
        "What is it, Petra? Something catch your eye?",
        "I heard that too. I'm not sure of the details though. That reminds me, I've been wondering... do you worship the goddess in Brigid?",
        "I guess it's natural for the ocean to have spiritual significance to you when you're surrounded by it. Since Brigid's made up of islands, your people must have a lot of experience with boats too.",
        "Swimming in the ocean? I've never had the chance! What's it like?",
        "That sounds amazing. I can't even imagine it. You must really love it though. Your description just now was very poetic. It makes my time swimming in rivers and lakes feel pretty small in comparison.",
        "Oh! Well, I'd definitely like to visit... It's not the right time for me to travel though. My duties as a knight will have to come first.",
        "Wait, what?! A whole knightly order, just like that?!",
        "I don't know, Petra. This is really ambitious.",
        "All right, all right. That smile of yours has gotten to me. I don't think I can refuse!",
        "Wow, you know a lot about this. I'm learning so much from you, Dedue. Were you a cook at the castle in Fhirdiad?",
        "Did your family own an eatery of some kind?",
        "Wow, that's all? I thought I was confident about my skills, but next to you, I feel like an amateur. Hey, could you give me some advice about other kinds of meat, besides fish?",
        "Yes, Dedue?",
        "We're friends, right? I just want to get to know you better. Is that so odd?",
        "So? Look at me— I came from a life of poverty. I was lucky to even be let in here, to study with all these high-class people. I think we have a lot in common.",
        "Oh, I know! But we can still be friends, can't we?",
        "So I'm told!",
        "You don't like to talk much, huh, Dedue?",
        "Any particular reason?",
        "That makes sense. A lot of people hate Duscur. They think all kinds of terrible things. Some of them even think you kidnap and eat people.",
        "Why are you smiling?! Shouldn't it make you angry?",
        "If those people would just talk to you, I'm sure they'd change their minds. I'll admit that when I first got here, I found you kind of intimidating. I didn't know if it was OK to talk to you. I hesitated. But like I said before, I just wanted to get to know you. And now that I have, I'm not scared at all.",
        "We can work on that. Tell me about Duscur. What was your hometown like?",
        "OK, maybe you're right. But answer me one thing. You're a great cook, and you learned at home. Why don't you make more Duscur-style food?",
        "Ah. But the cuisine of Duscur is delicious! I'd really like to try more of it!",
        "The scouting mission didn't go well. I was so busy I didn't even have time to eat.",
        "Thanks. I'm starving.",
        "Your cooking's fantastic, as always. The spices were a nice touch. I can really taste the Duscur inspiration. You remembered that I wanted to try more Duscur cuisine, didn't you?",
        "Amazing! You're a much better chef than I am.",
        "Haha, thanks. My father would be glad to hear it.",
        "Not exactly. I learned from watching him work the kitchen in his restaurant. And what about you? I think you said that you and your sister helped with the cooking at home.",
        "So, in a way, you put those memories into this meal.",
        "I like that way of thinking. The church may not like my feelings on this, but... In Fódlan, when people die, they pass on to be with the goddess, right?",
        "That seems so far away. I'd rather they stayed here. My parents, my brother, Lonato... Maybe they can all live on through me too.",
        "'''' Dedue... Your cooking is... delicious. It really is...",
        "Ah, that's all right. Thank you, Dedue...",
        "Hm. I must have left it in the library... Oh. Is that Felix?",
        "Hey, Felix! This is a surprise. I didn't think you had much interest in books. I'm already finished with that one. You can borrow it, if you'd like.",
        "Why not read a few pages, at least, while you've got it open? I think you'd really like it. The plot is pretty different from a typical knight's tale, but it's still really good. Do you like stories about adventure and chivalry?",
        "Yeah, well... Have you tried reading any? You might find them really interesting. I know I do!",
        "Well, for one thing, the knights in these stories are always gallant and brave. And they always value things like friendship, loyalty, and justice. That's the kind of knight I want to be.",
        "That's a little much. I was only interested in—",
        "You know something, Felix?",
        "You are exactly like the knight in this story!",
        "On the surface, he's sarcastic and intimidating. But underneath, he's kind and cares for his friends. In the end, they become heroes together and conquer all obstacles!",
        "Oh! See? Right there! That's just what I mean! You sound exactly like him!",
        "I'm going to lend you this book. Really, I insist. Just give it a read, all right? Trust me. And you can tell me what you think when you're done.",
        "Why, Lonato? Oh. Hey, Felix.",
        "I'm fine. I'm just frustrated by how little I was able to do. I know he was trying to protect me, but Lonato never really told me anything. In the end, I don't think I understood his feelings at all.",
        "You said it yourself. Be more moderate in your passions. To me, he always seemed like a knight out of a story. And I was so caught up in my ideals. I turned a blind eye to his sadness, his hatred...even when they were right in front of me. I guess I'm pretty far from real knighthood, huh?",
        "But before...you said...",
        "Thank you. Hearing you say that means a lot.",
        "Oh, the book I lent you... I'm guessing you hated it.",
        "Must have dug up some old feelings, then?",
        "That's just what I'd expect the knight in the story to say! It's not just the way you talk either. It's who you are as a person, deep down.",
        "You got it. I'll become the kind of knight only I can be!",
        "It's just my daily training. Maybe you could stand to be a little more eager yourself? If I want to be a great knight, I've got no choice but to put the effort in.",
        "That's not going to be me. I'm going to be a proud knight—virtuous and gallant!",
        "It's never wrong to have virtue. Not even if it means being made an outcast.",
        "Well, yes. So, what are you saying I should do?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Ah, Sylvain! Don't go bothering people!",
        "Helping out those in need. I guess that's a good start.",
        "A great knight, huh? More like a great philanderer. Seems like all he wants to do is flirt with women. No, I can't allow this. I have to stop him!",
        "Hey, Sylvain. Can we talk?",
        "Uh, no. But I did want to thank you for coming to my aid in battle the other day.",
        "No, really, I insist! If you hadn't been there, I definitely would have been finished! You really set a model for my training. I can only hope I'll be able to save someone like that someday.",
        "So, you're saying...",
        "Ah!",
        "No! No. I'm just surprised, that's all. You're actually a much better person than I thought.",
        "Oh—sorry! I didn't mean any insult. I was just really impressed by what you said about helping people without even thinking. To jump in and help someone without any thought at all of reward—that is real virtue.",
        "Huh?",
        "Sylvain!",
        "Fine. Since you helped me... But just this once.",
        "He really would be a great person, if he could just stop all the scandal...",
        "What's the matter, Mercedes?",
        "Let me taste it. Hmm, yeah, a little sweet. What if we try adding a few spices?",
        "My dad used to own a restaurant. I helped out a lot around the kitchen, even as a little kid.",
        "Well, no promises. I just have a little bot of experience, that's all. But look at you—you're great at baking cakes!",
        "I don't know. Maybe? What makes you say that?",
        "Oh, this won't end well. If I leave her to it, she'll make an even bigger mess.",
        "Um, hold on, Mercedes! Let me show you!",
        "That one goes best with meat, but for stir-fry, what you really want is this...",
        "Mercedes! What's going on?! Agh, my eyes! I can barely breathe!",
        "What did you put in there?!",
        "That explains it. We use that herb for smoke bombs! Just turn the heat off and cover the pan!",
        "Sorry, everybody! Could we clear out the dining hall for a few minutes, please?",
        "Well, some folks were a little annoyed, but at least we got the place cleared out. It's a good thing no one mistook all that smoke for an attack. That could have been a disaster.",
        "No, it's my fault. I should have taught you which herbs to avoid. Don't blame yourself.",
        "Next time? You still want to try again, even after all that?",
        "I guess that's true.",
        "That's a great point.",
        "Boiling, huh? Yeah, that'd be fine.",
        "Sounds good! I'd be happy to. Wow, Mercedes! This is delicious!",
        "Definitely! I should thank you too.",
        "Seeing you persevere has made me really happy. In fact, you've reminded me of someone I cared about a lot.",
        "Ah, I didn't mean it that way. I was actually thinking about my brother.",
        "He was the son of Lonato, my adoptive father. I always called him my brother though. Failure never got to him. All he'd ever do is laugh and try again. Whenever I was feeling down about a setback, he would cheer me up. He'd say something like, \"Don't worry. We'll tackle it together next time.\" I was always happy to have him around.",
        "He was. And I get the same feeling from you.",
        "What do you mean?",
        "I'm glad to hear you say that. Thank you, Mercedes! I know I can rely on you!",
        "I am! It's quiet here. Easier to concentrate.",
        "Oh, yes! We'll get a lot more done working together.",
        "Uh... Hmm...",
        "This question's got me stumped. \"A ballista inside a castle is ready to fire at enemies outside. What angle should be used for the shot? Assume the ballista is the same as those in Garreg Mach. Ignore the effects of wind.\" This is for defensive strategy, isn't it? Why is it so complicated? Don't you just aim and fire?",
        "Oh, that makes sense! Because the enemy line will be here!",
        "If the walls are this high, and the enemy lines are at that distance—ah! I think I see!",
        "Wow. I didn't expect math, of all things, to be useful in a siege. This is tough. Numbers are not my strong suit. But this really is the sort of thing you have to know if you want to command troops.",
        "I had no idea. Hey, you really know what you're doing, Annette!",
        "Definitely! You've obviously done a lot of studying. I really admire that.",
        "Ah—I've got it! Finally!",
        "Absolutely! You're great at this, you know. You really seem to have all the answers. I wish I could study and just soak up knowledge like you. How did you get so good at this?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "I'm so sorry to hear that. Losing a father so suddenly... I completely understand.",
        "Here? Really?!",
        "Oh, wow. So for you, studying has been like a way to meet your destiny.",
        "You've worked so hard. I really respect that. I'm going to follow your example!",
        "It's not a pleasant job, but someone has to do it.",
        "B-better than a ghost!",
        "You haven't seen what I've seen!",
        "Ahhh!",
        "I-it's OK! Just the wind blowing the door shut! Oh no, the latch is rusted! Ugh... It won't budge!",
        "I'm sorry! I didn't think to prop the door open!",
        "Well, what if we were to pry the boards off the windows?",
        "Oh! Ah! There's something on my face!",
        "Oh! I've got one here. Stand back!",
        "Oh... We made it.",
        "What is it?",
        "In the tower? Are you going back for it?",
        "Are you sure? If it was a gift from your father...",
        "Uh, right.",
        "Almost forgot how spooky this place is. I don't know if I can do this alone... No—I've got to. What use am I to anyone if I can't even handle an empty tower? Here goes...",
        "Annette!",
        "Phew... Here! I got this for you!",
        "Your father gave it to you. I know you said you'd throw it away, but you can't just toss out something so important.",
        "Well, ah, not really... I tried my best not to think about it. My legs shook whenever I did.",
        "Knock it off, would you? I'm OK now. But I'm glad I could help you and see a smile on your face. Look at me though. Haha, a grown man, scared of ghosts. Pathetic, right?",
        "Thanks. Maybe there is still hope for me as a knight.",
        "That's a frightening thought, comparing me to one of the king's best knights. But it's a happy one too. It makes me want to work that much harder!",
        "Ah—Ingrid! You gave me a start! How long have you been standing there?",
        "Oh, ah, it's quite an old book. One of the really old legends of Faerghus.",
        "Oh, so you know it!",
        "Exactly! I love the image of him charging forward into the fray, ready to take on any obstacle in the name of his king!",
        "Ah, the part about the War of the Eagle and Lion? That's my favorite part! \"In a flash, Kyphon's sword flew from its scabbard. The knight parried the assassin's blade mere inches from the spine of his king.\"",
        "I know just what you mean! I never get tired of it.",
        "I'm glad to find someone who shares my enthusiasm!",
        "Well, the first one I ever read was Loog and the Maiden of Wind.",
        "I know! When I first read it, I just couldn't get that ending out of my head.",
        "I'd love to! Yes, let's!",
        "Do you know this legend, Ingrid? It's about the battle of Fódlan's Throat.",
        "With so many valiant knights appearing in this story, I couldn't help but wonder which was your favorite. I really like this one—the one in the middle. The knight who stands in defense of the duke.",
        "That makes sense. He's so noble and virtuous. In fact, he kind of reminds me of you.",
        "Ah, no... I'm nowhere near as great. Maybe someday. Maybe if we work hard together, we can both become knights as glorious as the one in this story!",
        "Huh?",
        "What's that supposed to mean?",
        "You still have the right to pursue your dreams.",
        "Yes, of course. Anything.",
        "That doesn't seem fair.",
        "Come on, this isn't like you at all. Please... Don't smile when your eyes are so sad...",
        "There you are, Ingrid!",
        "A book I found in town. I bought it for you!",
        "I drove a hard bargain. Still, I'll probably have to cut back on my spending for a while.",
        "It wasn't easy, but as soon as I came across this legend, I knew you had to read it too.",
        "Fascinating, right? I was captivated from the moment I laid eyes on the cover.",
        "Yes! And she was a real historical figure! She was born into a noble family and bore a Crest, but she was accepted into the king's service as a knight. She fought in many battles at her king's side, serving him all her life as his right hand. Oh, sorry. I-I've said too much! I didn't mean to spoil the story for you. I'm just so excited. I hope you enjoy it too.",
        "That's the Ingrid I know!",
        "Great. When you're finished, and freshly inspired, we'll talk about becoming knights!",
        "Not the ones in stories either. The real thing!",
        "That's odd. I'm sure I just had it a moment ago.",
        "Ahh! Ghost!",
        "Goddess, protect me, I— Huh?",
        "Marianne! I'm so sorry. Yes, that's mine. Thank you so much.",
        "No, I'm the one who should be sorry. Kind of ridiculous, mistaking a friend for a ghost.",
        "No, of course you don't! It's just, I...um. In the dark, with your head down like that, and with your hair covering your eyes... I...uh...",
        "Ah! Please stop!",
        "Why not just lift your head up a little?",
        "Yes, that's so much better. With some light on your face, you don't look scary at all! That's great. You look completely normal now. Actually, you're pretty cute...",
        "Hm? N-nothing! Uh... Just keep your head up and smile! I promise you'll never be mistaken for a ghost again.",
        "What? Hey, wait! Was it something I said?",
        "Oh! Is that Marianne?",
        "Ah! Sorry, it's just—you turned so quickly, it gave me a start! I don't mean to interrupt your prayers, but what's with that posture? Don't you think lowering your head so much might, I don't know, offend the goddess? Maybe, um, maybe spook her a little?",
        "Confessing? What are you confessing for?",
        "That can't possibly be necessary. There's no way you're as bad as you make it seem. I've seen how kind you are with the horses. And I've noticed you're always sensitive to everyone's tastes when you cook.",
        "Yeah, well...if either of us is going to confess, it should be me. I used to be a thief. I may have only stolen because I was poor and starving, but it was still wrong. I'm only even here because a kindly noble helped me. I'm only even here thanks to Lonato. He gave me a second chance, and now I eat well every day. I'm doing all I can to make the most of it. You're a noble yourself, aren't you? The daughter of Margrave Edmund, I think? And if you're a noble, that means... Do you happen to have a Crest?",
        "I knew it! That's great, Marianne!",
        "Please, don't be modest! It's an extraordinary gift. You should be proud of it! If I had one, I'd use it to make sure my brother and sister never had to live in poverty. Think about all the good you could do for the world with your power.",
        "No, not again! I'm not good at this...",
        "Oh, Marianne. Are you confessing again today?",
        "For me?",
        "No, I'm the one who should be sorry. I only wanted to give you some advice, but I ended up running you off.",
        "Of course!",
        "What do you mean?",
        "That still sounds kind of negative to me. What does being fulfilled even mean here, anyway? Are you saying that people without dreams live empty lives? I don't agree with that. When I was a kid, I was too busy worrying about my next meal to have a dream. Was my life empty then?",
        "Hey, chin up! Maybe I can help. I'm sure we can come up with something for you in no time if we put our heads together.",
        "Absolutely! Unless, uh, you don't want me to, of course.",
        "You think so? Thank you, Gilbert!",
        "Wow. 40 years! That's incredible. With that many years of training, I'd be really strong, wouldn't I?",
        "But of course! It's been my dream for a long time, now. I really can't help but admire you. Your years of knighthood are so impressive!",
        "Don't be modest. You're a great knight! If there's any more you can teach me, I would be very happy to learn.",
        "Protect? I, um... Well, whatever needs protecting, right?",
        "I understand. I'll take that to heart. What is it that you want to protect, if I may ask?",
        "Oh. How come?",
        "Discipline, huh... Something to protect. I'll have to think of something.",
        "I'm sorry. Something's been bothering me.",
        "You were sworn to protect the royal family. But when we met five years ago, you weren't in the Kingdom capital. You were in Garreg Mach. What could have made a great knight like you abandon his vow?",
        "I am. It affected me too. My brother was suspected of being involved in the attack, and so the church... They...",
        "Why are you apologizing? It's not your fault.",
        "Is that why you left Faerghus?",
        "I would never laugh at something like that. But I do think you should have seen things through to the end. Even if you had to endure dishonor for a while, you could have restored your name!",
        "I'm sorry. That was inconsiderate of me. I got carried away by how much your situation resembles my own.",
        "I don't understand what you mean. What should Lonato have protected?",
        "You're right...",
        "I think I know what I need to protect now. It's been staring me in the face all this time. I don't know why I couldn't see it. I'm Lonato's son. His pride and his wishes are my inheritance. Those are what I should protect.",
        "It's too early to say that, but I'm willing to learn if you'll teach me!",
        "Hello, Catherine. I thought I might find you here.",
        "Yes. Could you tell me what you know about this?",
        "It was found in the bishop's room during the inquiry of the Western Church.",
        "This letter mentions my brother, Christophe Gaspard, by name.",
        "He was executed by the church for allegedly taking part in the Tragedy of Duscur. I know you were the one who turned him over. But this letter isn't about that. It's about a plot to assassinate Lady Rhea. If my brother's name is in here, that means this plot predates the Tragedy. So there was another plot against Lady Rhea in the past. And my brother was somehow involved.",
        "I can tell by your face that you know something. Tell me, Catherine. Please, I deserve to know!",
        "Just how well did you know my brother?",
        "If you were friends, why did you hand him over to be executed? There must have been another way!",
        "I can't believe that my brother would try to assassinate Lady Rhea. But if he did, that means the church was lying about his involvement in the Tragedy of Duscur, doesn't it?",
        "So you're saying everything in this letter is true.",
        "Catherine, wait! Please!",
        "I've been thinking. No matter what I do, Lonato and my brother are never coming back.",
        "I don't know. Maybe I do. I know you're an ally I can trust. A knight I can respect...but maybe I do.",
        "What?",
        "I don't think that's going to help.",
        "Ngh...",
        "Rrrrgh!",
        "Catherine...",
        "I don't know what's right anymore. I don't.",
        "What about a friend? How could you kill a friend to protect her, with no hesitation?",
        "Catherine...",
        "I...",
        "Can I tell you honestly?",
        "As a knight, an ally, and even as a person... I know I can trust you. But somewhere in my heart, there's a part of me that can't forgive what you did.",
        "I admire your spirit, Catherine. Honestly, I do. I hope the part of me that's holding this grudge will get smaller with time. Maybe someday it'll vanish.",
        "Maybe, but...I'm being serious!",
        "No, it's all right. We should have talked like this much sooner. I feel like I can finally stop dwelling on the past, and start looking forward to the future.",
        "Can I ask something of you? I'd like to get to know you better, Catherine. As a person...and as my friend.",
        "Me? It won't be very interesting for you, but OK.",
        "Christophe. Lonato. Watch over me, please...",
        "Coming!",
        "What are all these books doing on the floor? Hey, Cyril, what's going on here?",
        "Isn't there a schedule for library cleaning duty? Why are you doing all of this by yourself?",
        "But there are so many. You really think you'll get all this done today?",
        "And I guess you're planning to do all that by yourself too.",
        "Come on, it'll be dusk soon. Let me help.",
        "There is no way one person can shelve all these books before nightfall, Cyril!",
        "I can't just stand here and watch. I won't get in your way, all right? I'll handle this shelf and you take the next one.",
        "I promise I'll be careful, OK? Let's just get to it.",
        "Got it.",
        "Hey there, Cyril. Is there something on your mind?",
        "Huh? When do you mean?",
        "Ah, right! That was quite a while ago! I'd completely forgotten about it. No need to thank me though. It was nothing. Do you need help with anything today? I've got some spare time. I really don't mind.",
        "I could give you a hand though, couldn't I?",
        "Oh, so it's a status thing. I can understand that. I can get pretty awkward if I ever have to ask a favor from a noble.",
        "You don't need to feel that way around me though. I'm just a commoner. I'm only in here thanks to a bit of luck, so really, I'm just the same as you.",
        "Either way, birth and social status don't really matter for us, do they? After all, we're friends, right?",
        "Yeah. And when a friend needs you, you've got to help, don't you?",
        "It's easy. If I'm in trouble, you help me out. And if you need something, I help you too.",
        "Sure! Whenever you need a hand, just let me know.",
        "No good. I've lost sight of them completely, and those monsters might still be out there... I'd better get back to the monastery before dark.",
        "Cyril? What are you doing here? You're awfully far from your post.",
        "You came all this way for that? Alone? It's dangerous out here.",
        "Of course not. This is a big help actually. You took a serious risk coming out here though.",
        "I did say that. You're right. Come on, let's get back to the monastery. I could use your help finding the way.",
        "Maybe. Leaving your post is against orders. But don't worry. I'll take a share of the punishment.",
        "True. We're friends though, aren't we?",
        "I wouldn't put it like that. I'd say friends stick together, through good and bad. So, let's split the blame. That's what friends are for.",
        "Good. I hope you remember that, because I think we're going to be friends for a long time.",
        "What makes you so certain this incident was caused by her sighing? It seems unfair to cast blame until you're truly sure.",
        "Hey! You didn't answer my question!",
        "No, you told me you had nothing to do with this. I can't just leave it alone.",
        "But I do! What if they pressured you into confessing something you hadn't actually done? They mean well, but they seem to think they have good reasons to suspect you. Those suspicions could lead to forceful questioning. They'll do anything to get to the bottom of this.",
        "No. I know you don't sigh unless you absolutely can't help it. You would never endanger people like that unless something pushed you over the edge. I know this wasn't your fault. You said as much, and I believe you.",
        "Then we'll find proof! If you didn't cause it, then something else did. We just have to find out what. I'll investigate the site where we were attacked. There could be a monster nest nearby",
        "Your commitment to honesty is as strong as mine. You'd never turn your back on our common bond!",
        "Hey, come on! I was being serious!",
        "If that's how you feel...then I'm going to live up to it. I'll do my best to make sure you never sigh again!"

        "Oh, good. Bye! Uh, good-bye!",
        "Finally...Oh, that was awful. Just terrifying.",
        "I wonder why... You know, Professor, you might be the first person I've been able to speak to normally since I got here and I have no idea why.",
        "I'm happy about it too! When we first started out here, we had to do drills...outside. I skipped those every chance I got. It's a terrible idea— going out in the forest with all these people you don't even know! Thanks to you, though, I can actually make it through class now. I'm grateful for that. I don't know what I'd do...if you weren't here...",
        "Sorry... I'm OK... I am OK. I'm doing just fine. I feel safe here, thanks to you.",
        "What? Y-you saw that? Why would you see that?! You were watching me?! That crosses the line, Professor! Singing? Me?! Why would I be singing? I'd never be singing! Ah! I've never been so humiliated!",
        "'''' Useless! Worthless! Unmarriageable! Augh!",
        "Great weather today. Perfect for shutting yourself inside, don't you think?",
        "I love feeling like I'm all alone in the world...",
        "Oh, that. Well, I guess I can tell you, Professor. My father's obsessed with money. He's only ever seen me as bait for a rich husband. To train me to be a good, submissive wife, he'd do things like tie me to a chair and leave me there all day, challenging me to stay quiet. I tried hard to do as he asked. Honestly, I did. But before I knew it, I just couldn't bring myself to leave my room anymore.",
        "I just had this overwhelming feeling of fear all the time. No matter how hard I tried, my father never thought I was good enough. After that, it was just constant scolding. He couldn't say two words to me without mentioning how useless I was. An unmarriageable girl. My life was isolated to say the least. I wasn't allowed to play with other kids, let alone make friends. Soon, I stopped wanting that. I was happiest alone. But even that made him mad. And when he tried to drag me outside, I kicked and screamed so much I seriously hurt myself. He's calmed down a bit in recent years. His constant torment was replaced with complete indifference. He mostly acts like I don't exist now.",
        "If you can believe it, I was basically kidnapped. My mother ordered an attendant to stuff me in a bag while I was sleeping. By the time I figured out what was going on, I was already here. For a while, I was sure I was going to die. But here I am. Look at me...still breathing. Ah, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to get you down, talking like that about my past! Just forget everything I told you. There's no point in talking about myself anyway. '''' Idiot! Oh this is why everyone hates you, Bernie!",
        "I'm sorry! Please don't look at me!",
        "I can't believe how long it's been since I left home. Since I was dragged out of the house, I mean. Five whole years. It's weird to think about.",
        "I have friends here, and I have you. The monastery's become a second home to me. Back then, I never would've dreamed a day like this would come.",
        "It's all thanks to you! You've given me a second chance at life! If not for you, I never would have gotten used to leaving my room, let alone the monastery. Maybe the battlefield's just dulled my senses. I'm much better with strangers and new places now though. I don't panic nearly as much as before.",
        "That sounds like a tough assignment. Where did this come from all of a sudden? Hey, hold on... You're teasing me, aren't you?! Please don't joke around like that anymore! It's torture for me!",
        "Promise me you won't do that again! Friends respect each other's feelings, don't they?",
        "Good... I'll hold you to that. You're absolutely not allowed to send me out anywhere on my own! Got it? You would need to come with me. If you're with me, I can go anywhere in the world.",
        "No, that defeats the purpose! Why can't you get what I'm saying?! Oh, that's enough. I need some time alone...",
        "How did you know I was here?",
        "Once I got to thinking about the war being over, a lot of my old fears started to return. I'm afraid to go home... afraid to see my parents... I don't know what to do! Please, help me!",
        "Wait! Where are we going?! Don't make me go!",
        "The Goddess Tower? What are we doing here? This is it... We're all alone... The perfect time... You're going to kill me, aren't you?!",
        "All right, I've made my peace, and for what it's worth, I'm glad it's— Wait, you wouldn't? Of course you wouldn't. I'm not even worth killing, am I? I knew it all along. I'll go lock myself away now...",
        "Wh-what did you just say? Is that... a ring?! Well, um... This is, um.... What kind of ring is this? When a man gives a woman a ring, it usually only means... Is that what this means? I... I don't know what to say! I accept! Of course I accept! This means... I'll be able to shut myself away in peace again. You can go off doing your hero things, and I'll hold down the fort!",
        "There's a reason I've been able to cope with going out of the monastery so much. It's because I've been with you. I'll never completely get over my anxiety... of my fear of strangers... or my compulsive need to run and hide. So whenever you tell me to go outside, I want you to come with me. Wherever we go, whatever we do... I want us to be together, always.",
        "'''Because when I'm with you, I feel... Wait. Did you agree? You mean it?! Ah, you're the greatest! I... I love you so much! We're going to be so happy together!'''",

        "Finally...Oh, that was awful. Just terrifying.",
        "Oh yeah? How about when I first met you and I wouldn't come out of the corner or even uncover my face? Actually, now that you mention it, it's funny. Once I started talking to you, I stopped feeling scared. I wonder why... You know, Professor, you might be the first person I've been able to speak to normally since I got here and I have no idea why.",

        "I decided to watch you from a distance, to learn from you. But your presence is, um...intimidating. I got more and more scared until I finally couldn't help but try to hide! Ah, forgive me. I throw myself upon your mercy!",
        "What? You do?",
        "N-no, of course not! But, um, what in the world could possibly frighten you?",
        "The sea? I think I may have seen it once. Maybe... I didn't know you couldn't swim. That's a surprise.",

        "Yes!",
        "Yes!",
        "Um... I wanted to listen until you were finished. Ah, sorry! Were you finished then?",
        "Then, may I please scream now?",
        "Just a tiny one.",
        "Um, wait. What was I upset about, again? That's weird. I forgot why I was about to scream, and now I don't even need to. What a nice feeling!",
        "B-but what? What'd I do this time? I'm so sorry! Whatever it is! I'll go to my room and never bother you again!",
        "Aaaah!",
        "Gardening with you is a lot of fun, Lady Edelgard!",
        "I looked after flowers a lot back home. I like them. They don't talk... They don't get angry... They don't hit you. And they're sweet.",
        "You're sweet too, Lady Edelgard! I mean—not sweet, but, um... You know what I mean. You can talk or even get angry all you want...",
        "You're really kind. I'm less scared of you than I used to be. Most nobles are terrifying. I've had lots of bad experiences with them. But getting the chance to talk to you like this makes me glad I came to the monastery.",
        "Rumors? About me?! Uh, just...pretend you didn't hear anything!",

        "Thank me? What for? Wait, do you mean you need to \"thank\" me for all the times I've made you mad?! You do, don't you?!",
        "Oh, I'm done for! Five years' worth of resentment is about to crash down on me all at once! Aaaah!",
        "Oh. Um... I jumped to conclusions again, didn't I?",
        "Right! OK. Thank you!",
        "Of course I will! Hey, look! This flower's just about ready to bloom.",
        "Being outside is so tiring. Tomorrow's got to be just an inside day, Bernie.",
        "Whoa, why is it so cold all of a sudden? It's as if an unspeakable evil just— Ah!",
        "No, into the light! Back to the beyond from whence you came!",

        "You're going to execute me, aren't you? Please, let me compose my last will and testament! Or at least a swan song? The creak of a door... Sorrow like a needlepoint... Bernie's gone away.",
        "Um, Hubert?",
        "I just, um... I wanted to thank you. For the other day. You know, when I...fainted. Thank you for carrying me back to my room.",
        "I guess that's true. Well, thanks. There, I said it, and now I'm going.",
        "Uh, vulture's a bit— Well, yes.",
        "Um... Well, that's—",

        "Oh... Good point. I'm sorry I said you were terrifying.",
        "B-but you've been avoiding me since then, right? You even stopped doing your deathly grin.",
        "Um, it's not working. And yes, there is. You can't quit talking and laughing just to try to make me feel better. That's not really fair. I need to master my own fear!",

        "Ah! Why?!",
        "Yes. I mean, someday it might...maybe. Ah! I'm not ready!",
        "Um, I've got something to give you.",
        "A token of apology for all of the rude stuff I've said. It's, um... It's only right. I hope this will help you let go of all the grudges you're probably holding against me!",
        "You will? Great! Here you go!",
        "But it's, um, lovely you said, right? That's why. If you wear it, maybe you'll look less, um... terrifying.",
        "Ah! You hate it, don't you?! I knew it. I knew you'd be angry... Ugh, I'm so sorry!",
        "No, it does! It looks great on you! Heh-heh...",

        "I do like my time alone. Actually, it's more of a need. But you're right. I also need to venture out every once in a while. Maybe if I work as hard as you do, I can try it a little more.",

        "This is it... the same view. After all that time inside, the sun feels like it's piercing right through me.",
        "What?! Um, but— OK. But if you get sick of me, I'm sorry ahead of time!",
        "Ah, it's peaceful here. Flowers are so calming. Just looking at these, it's like all the terrible parts of the day just disappear. If only people could be more like flowers...",
        "All these nobles are just terrifying, and the commoners... Just look at Dorothea. So pretty, popular, dazzling... There's no way someone like me could ever be close with someone like that.",

        "Um, n-no. I was...actually thinking about...being friends with you.",
        "That's n-not what I mean. Oh, I'm such a coward! I thought it would be great if we could be closer. But old memories just get in the way for me.",

        "Yeah. But once, a long time ago, I did secretly make friends with one...a boy. When my father found out about him, he disappeared the very next day. I heard he was found beaten half to death. I never saw him again. Since then, I've been terrified of making friends with anyone. Commoners, especially.",
        "Dorothea!",

        "You're incredible, Dorothea.",
        "All right. Yeah. Yeah!",
        "Petra's really nice. Never yells, never says mean things about people. Maybe she'd be my friend. Oh, there she is now. OK, Bernie, you can do this!",
        "Ah! How did you know? Do you have eyes on the back of your head or something?!",
        "Right... Um, can I ask you something? Do you want to, um...maybe, uh...be friends or something? Maybe? Maybe you don't. Maybe you don't like me. I don't know what you think of me.",
        "Wh-what?",
        "Oh, you...try not to shoot me. That's, um...nice.",
        "So you're saying you might end up hunting me?!",
        "Th-that isn't comforting! Whatever I did to deserve this, forgive me!",
        "Hunting? Really? There's no way I can do this. Goddess, why couldn't I have stayed in today...",
        "The duties all got assigned while I was holed up in my room...",
        "Oh, um... OK, then...",
        "So it's not an enemy. It's food. But, um, how is it food when it's still alive?",
        "K-killer?!",
        "Maybe, but I don't know if I want to be some...some kind of vegetable murderer!",
        "A task. Yes, just a task. A completely mindless task.",
        "Uh, right. That makes sense. It's just like cutting a stem.",
        "I am? I have? Oh, good! What a relief.",
        "Great! Leave it to me. I'll hunt down my prey just like they're vegetables.",
        "Aw, thanks, Petra! I can do this! Make way for Huntmaster Bernie!",
        "Ugh! Ow! Wh-what? No! Stay back! I'm sorry, Mr. Rabbit! I didn't mean it! Why are you the one chasing me?! Ow!",
        "Oh no. It's Felix. He's coming right at me. If I run, he'll chase me. Maybe if I just hold really, really still...",
        "Whatever it is, I didn't do it! I swear! Unless I'm offending you just by standing here?!",
        "Huh? Oh. Yeah, that's my satchel. Wait, wh-where did you get that?!",
        "No! Trap! It's a trap!",
        "Acting?! Does this terror on my face look fake to you?!",
        "I can't! Your icy glare has frozen me completely!",
        "No! P-please don't kill me!",
        "Sword! He's got a sword! Aaaah!",
        "I can't do this anymore!",
        "Ah! What'd I do?! Am I in your way? I'm in your way. I know. I get it. I'm sorry. I can't stand the sight of me either!",
        "Irritating, I know! I completely— What? No, I mean, I know I'm irritating, but—Huh?",
        "Sword? Teach? Technique?! That's, um, that's a joke, right? Because that's...that's just about the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.",
        "Nope! Wasn't Bernie. You must have dreamed it. Unless my accuser dares to produce some evidence.",
        "Oh, my satchel. W-wait, that? No, that's, um... That's not mine. You can't prove it's mine!",
        "I'm innocent—I swear! Merciful Seiros, save me!",
        "Aaaah!",
        "Lies! All lies! I didn't do any—Huh? Wh-where'd he go?",
        "Ah! It's all over! I'm done for!",
        "Felix? Is that really you? Thank you so much! I was sure I was finished. You saved my life! I can never repay—Huh?",
        "Um... What?",
        "Uh, in that case, I'm...happy to help?",
        "Hey, come on! I was running for my life! Don't make fun of me for—Huh? No way...",
        "You're actually smiling! Not like a sarcastic smirk either—a big goofy grin from ear to ear! You're just a big old nut, aren't you Felix? Once you get through the shell, there's all sorts of good stuff inside.",
        "Aww, there's that shell again.",
        "Ah! I didn't mean anything by it! I'm sorry!",
        "Hey Felix! Can I talk to you for a minute?",
        "Look, over there! Isn't that a cute kitty?!",
        "Here, try this. It's candy, but I promise it isn't sweet.",
        "Hey, are you busy? I've got this great book, and...",
        "Huh?",
        "Oh, I'm shy as ever.",
        "That's, um... Well, you know how ghosts are only scary because you can't see or talk to them?",
        "What?! No! It was, uh, just a metaphor!",
        "That's it! You're smiling again!",
        "That's why I've been working so hard to talk to you. I wanted to see you smile again.",
        "Um... Yeah, I guess. Wait, why are you being nice? Did something terrible happen?! Did you have a falling-out with an old friend or something?!",
        "This is the part where you angry at me, isn't it?",
        "Really?! Well, um... It's, um... This one! If you wouldn't mind...",
        "So full! That fruit really hit the spot... Time to get nice and snug, maybe do some sewing...",
        "What? N-no! Nothing at all!",
        "Sorry, um... Was someone talking about a story?",

        "Ugh, he actually read it! I regret everything... Even if I burn the pages, I can't burn his memory. Not unless I... throw him in the fire too... No, that's awful. Don't think things like that, Bernie.",
        "Ugh... I've looked everywhere... I guess Sylvain must still have it... Huh? When did this book get here? Wait. This is mine! And there's... something sticking out of it... A letter?",
        "Heh-heh! Wow, so many compliments, and so much attention to detail.",
        "Um, what? My own experiences? That's a weird way to give praise... Who wrote this anyways? Who would read my story so carefully and then write this long letter to tell me about it? Whoever it is, they must be wonderful. Someone like my dear old uncle...",
        "What?! Sylvain?! It can't be!",
        "Ah! How long have you been standing there?!",
        "Oh, I see your plan now! You're out to humiliate me! Very clever, but I'm not falling for it!",

        "Um, uh... Right. OK. Good.",
        "Oh! You, um... You didn't break the door down again looking for me, did you?",

        "But even if I did train, what's the point? It's not like it would do much good.",

        "Help...",
        "That was really fun, Bernie. Good thing I found such an out-of-the-way spot to play. Only the pretty flowers heard me here. Isn't that right, little flower? You're the only one who heard, aren't you? What did you think?",

        "Oh no. Raphael, you heard it all, didn't you?",
        "All the way from the training grounds?! Ugh!",
        "Good? No. No, I'm on to you. First you flatter me, then you get me to perform on stage in front of everyone to humiliate me!",

        "I'm hopelessly terrified of you, so every time I see you, I kind of lose my mind. But once you're gone and I get time to calm down, I realize I'm making a big deal out of nothing. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you before. I feel awful! I hope you can forgive me!",
        "No! No, you did nothing wrong! It's all my fault.",

        "I'll bet she would! How could she possibly forget such a terrifying— Um... Such a terrific big brother? There's no way!",
        "Oh! Um... Actually, we can eat here. I cooked something up for us today.",
        "I heard you really like meat, so, um—here you go! It's my first time cooking something like this. I can at least guarantee it isn't poisoned.",
        "Is it, uh...good?",
        "Really? You like it?",
        "Is sweet bad? I thought it was pretty tasty, myself.",
        "Well, if you like it, I wouldn't mind, um, making more. Whenever you want, really!",

        "I'm actually pretty good at sewing.",
        "What?! Hold on— Don't— You can't just— Aaaah!",
        "Um, here. I patched up the clothes you gave me.",
        "Craft? You mean my embroidery?",
        "Uh, I'm glad you liked it. At first, I felt like you thought it was stupid. I was worried you secretly hated me or something. It made me pretty scared to show you my stitching.",
        "Oh, um. It's nothing.",
        "It zips out from the trees and strikes — just like you!",
        "Um. What?",
        "Oh, no-no-no-no. I could never do that. Trust me, I'm completely useless.",

        "♪ Hm hm-hm-hmm... ♪ Oh, is that Seteth? Wow... He looks really deep in thought. I wonder what he's writing... A secret diary, maybe?",
        "Hmm, too uncertain for a diary. Maybe it's a letter... or a poem!",
        "It must be really important if he's putting that much thought into every word.",
        "Parting? It's a farewell letter? Huh! Is he writing his resignation? Seteth can be a little scary sometimes, but I hope he doesn't leave. It'd be sad to see him go. He shouldn't make such rash decisions. If he's unhappy about something, he should tell someone!",
        "Ah! You...you heard all that?!",
        "Uh, I just... Ah, I'm sorry! I won't disturb you ever again!",
        "Um, excuse me.",
        "I'm really sorry about what I said. I shouldn't have called you scary. Even if, um... you are. Ah, I said it again! I'm sorry!",
        "Don't be sad! I'll never do it again. I promise. But, um, I've been wondering... Were you really writing a farewell letter?",
        "I didn't know you wrote fables. Wh-what's it about?",
        "I like him already.",
        "Um... What's that about a lake?",
        "I like it...but I don't have any talents like that. I can't even imagine being that helpful to people. Saint Indech must have been really gifted.",
        "Um. Yes, I do. You really think we're alike? Now I want to know all about him! Do you think I could read your fable when it's done?",
        "Thanks so much! I'm excited to see it!",
        "Here's your book of fables you lent me, Seteth. It was so interesting to learn all about Saint Indech that I read it cover to cover in one sitting!",
        "No, nothing like that! I must have stuck it in there and forgotten... Just, um—give it back, please!",
        "No-no-no-no, not at all! I was just fooling around... I have an overactive imagination, and I forgot to take it out before I gave you the book back.",
        "Oh, um, that's Saint Cichol. The book describes him as one of Saint Indech's closest friends. I got the feeling he was a very serious man but also really kind. You know, like you. So that probably explains the, um, resemblance.",
        "Wh-what about furious violence?!",
        "Wh-what? How do we figure into this?",
        "You really want me to? I don't know if I'm good enough for something like that!",
        "Yes, I have! Finally. This is the first time I've ever made anything for a real live book. I was up all night finishing these! Bernie's all \"Berned\" out now. I guess if they're no good, we'll just have to \"Bern\" 'em all, eh? Heh-heh!",
        "So, um... Wh-what do you think?",
        "Really? Oh, that's such a relief! It was a tough job, but—yeah! There's nothing Bernie can't handle!",
        "Oh no... What did I get wrong?!",
        "Um, yes. Is that wrong? What's wrong with it?",
        "Oh. Um, no. That's Saint Cichol.",
        "Well, I got the impression that the story of Saint Indech was told from Saint Cichol's point of view. So I just imagined that I asked Saint Cichol about it, and, um, that's where the picture came from. I guess I overdid it, huh? That's weird, isn't it? It's really weird. We can scrap it. Let's just get rid of it.",
        "Um... It is?",
        "What?! Saint Cichol and me? N-no way! I've already got my hands full just trying to be friends with you! But I've managed that at least, right? Haven't I?",
        "Um... Hi! Can I help you?",
        "I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean, but OK. What business do you have with Bernie?",
        "Right... Thanks for taking the time.",
        "Thanks. I'm going to head in now, if that's OK.",
        "Ah! What? Me?! I-I've seen nothing! I w-wasn't even there! You have no proof! And even if I was there, it's not a crime to find people's hobbies fascinating! I'll forget everything! I'll never tell a soul where I found them or what they were wearing or any of it!",
        "Huh? Oh... Oh, it's you, Alois. What a relief.",
        "Did you want to talk to me about something?",
        "Um, were you hoping I would be?",
        "Well, I guess it's because you remind me of my uncle. He's the only one in my family who's ever been kind to me, and he's the only man I can talk to normally. Actually, I'm fine with the professor too. So I guess that's not completely true anymore. My uncle and I never did talk that much, but we didn't need to. We just understood each other. Anyway, you really remind me of him. So talking to you feels comfortable.",
        "Kind of, but I think it's more your personality.",
        "Yeah, you're always so bright, cheerful, and gentle. You put people at ease.",
        "Oh... My uncle? Um... I, uh... I just remembered something. I have to go!",

        "Huh? Was there something you did? I don't remember anything...",
        "Oh, that. Don't worry about it.",
        "Hey, it's OK. You're reminding me of him even now. And it's completely fine! I'm glad we talked about it.",
        "The truth is I realized I hadn't visited my uncle's grave in a long time. With me not showing up for so long, I imagined him being worried about me...",
        "Hey, that gives me a great idea! Why don't we go see my uncle together sometime?",
        "Sure you do. You're connected by me!",
        "Great! Thanks, Unc— Ugh... Thanks, Alois.",
        "Aaah!",

        "Wait, what? You're not Professor Jeritza?! Oh, yeah! Professor Jeritza's always a mask. So then... Uh... Who are you?",
        "Uh... I don't understand. Look... Are you Professor Jeritza, or aren't you? Please, make yourself clear!",
        "A Jeritza who is not a professor... So there are two Jeritzas running around the Monastery?",
        "Oh, wait... Ah! Aha! I got it. I get it now! You're no longer a professor, therefore you're just Jeritza. Plain old Jeritza. Our professor isn't a professor anymore, either, but doesn't mind the title. I guess I figured you'd be fine with being called professor as well.",
        "I don't really get it, but it sounds like there's a lot going on in that skull of yours, Jeritza. Oh, Bernie, what the heck are you even doing in the infirmary?",
        "Huh? Don't be silly. There's absolutely no reason I'd faint at the sight of you, Jeritz-",
        "I... Uh... Uh! I'm coming down with a sudden cold, I think. Yeah. I've...uh...gotta run to my room!",
        "Jeritza?",
        "Heh heh, I've got it all figured out.",
        "Your true identity!",
        "If my detective skills are correct, then you...are... The Death Knight! ...Right?!",
        "Huh? What? Everyone knows? But...how?! Ugh, and here I thought that I had uncovered your big, spooky secret. Oh, Bernie...you're such a shut-in that you missed the biggest news in town...",
        "So here's the deal, Jeritza. You've gotta tell me a secret about you that nobody else knows.",
        "Because! I sleuthed for hours upon hours! That's gotta be rewarded!",
        "Aw, come on. Please? Oh, oh! I know! I've got it! Why do you wear that crazy-looking armor when you're pretending to be the Death Knight? Are you just into the look of it? You like spooky stuff?",
        "Oh, I see! I thought, maybe you put on that mask and armor because, just like ol' Bernie, you don't like talking to people.",
        "Heh heh...",
        "Oh yeah?! I think I'm sensing a real kinship between us! So with that whole spooky getup on, it allowed you to speak to people with confidence!",
        "Oh, hey, Jeritza? Don't tell anyone about this, OK? This is our little secret!",
        "Oh no! Am I bothering you? I am, aren't I? I knew you were getting too carried away, Bernie! I mean, it's no wonder you don't wanna have lunch with me anymore. Just having me around probably makes your food taste awful...",
        "Oh...",
        "Aaah! Please forgive me! I am so sorry I've been using you to avoid people! The truth is hardly anyone ever comes near us, and it's been such a relief!",
        "Huh? You...don't?",
        "Oh? Uh... Hmm... I... I mean, of course not, Jeritza! I didn't mean anything like that at all! Ha! Kindred spirits?! Us?! Ha...ha... Ha... But I mean... Totally hypothetical here, but, uh... If I did think we were kindred spirits, would...uh...there be a problem with that?",
        "Uh... Oooh. I see. I, uh... I'm not quite sure how to say this, but...I'm willing to take the risk. I mean, we're in the middle of a war! I could die at any point now, even tomorrow! So if being near you means feeling comfortable during my final hours, well, that sounds like a pretty good deal to me!",
        "I...wasn't entirely being honest with you just now, about the whole kindred spirits thingy... Want the real truth? I actually think we are. You and I have a whole lore in common. We both had a dark, troubling past. We both build walls around ourselves in response to that, to keep people out. Me, I take all my past hurts out on myself, but you... Jeritza, you take yours out on the world. Maybe that's why you harm people.",
        "Uh. Uh! Ah! That was really overstepping, wasn't it? I'm sorry!"

        "Oh no...",
        "Heh. Heck of a coincidence, right? Soon as I mention that suspicious guy, this happens...",
        "But some of the knights died in combat. They died because of what I did five years ago. This is my fault... If I'd stayed quiet and tracked the guy down like you said, we would've stopped those brigands sooner. And I wouldn't have blood on my hands...",
        "Do you have a minute, Professor? I gotta talk to you. I've been thinking a lot about those brigands with the scorpion tattoos, and I realized something... I mean, I'll feel better if I get this off my chest, right?",
        "I think... I can't deny who I am. I know you were right five years ago when you told me not to chase after that suspicious guy... But I still can't get over the possibility that he might have hurt those kids. I would have regretted not stopping him for the rest of my life. There's no way I could forgive myself. It sounds awful to say, but the safety of those kids is more important to me than the knights we lost. I'm sorry, Professor, but I can't promise that I won't disobey your orders in the future.",

        "... I don't... I don't really know what to say. I guess I never thought about marriage. I mean, I never had a reason to. Ugh, now I'm babbling. I always secretly hoped I could spend my life with you, but this is so unexpected. Come on! You can't just spring something like this on me! Now I'm flustered and I can't think of the right thing to say. I'm just...so happy. And I can't stop grinning. I bet I look like a real fool right now!",
        "All right. Now that I've pulled myself together, I want to tell you the same thing you told me. I love you, and I want to marry you! Listen, I know I can be reckless, stubborn, and generally difficult to be around at times... But you once said you'd accept me, even with all of my flaws. When you said that, I made a promise to myself. I promised that I'd always protect you. And, well, sometimes you might have to protect me from myself, but I intend to keep my promise.",

        "You think so? Thanks! I appreciate that. I can't really stop training though. I gotta get better if I expect to get anywhere in this world.",
        "That's right. My older brother is the heir, and there are already too many mouths to feed in our family, so I can't count on any support. I pretty much have to make it on my own, you know?",
        "What are you talking about? I don't have any troubles. Who cares if I don't inherit anything? It just means I get to cut a path to my own future. You know what your problem is, Edelgard? You always have to make everything about you.",
        "Hey now, come on. I didn't mean to be disrespectful. Always happy to fight though, if that's what you want.",
        "What was that about? I'll never understand her...",
        "Of course! My brother probably wouldn't be too happy about it though. I've got nothing against him, and I'd hate to cause him trouble, so I guess it wouldn't make me very happy at all.",
        "You don't hold anything back, do you? But to be honest, you're not too far off. He's got good reason for it though. Our grandfather was really obsessed with his second wife. She has a son who she really wanted to become the heir. In the end though, my grandfather had to step down sooner than expected, so everything went to my father instead. My brother is still really worried about having his future taken from him.",
        "Wow, this conversation is really going there. You may be right, but it's not like the world is ever going to change, right?",
        "What do you think would happen to me in that kind of world? Would you appoint me as a general or Minister of Military Affairs?",
        "Right, so my life would pretty much stay the same. I'd still have to train, get stronger, and use my abilities to cut my own path. I don't know what I'm going to do after we graduate. I guess I'll just have to fight for you.",
        "At the base, the front lines, or wherever we might be fighting, I'll be there with all my might! Raaar!",
        "Huh? What's wrong, Edelgard?",
        "You always look at me funny, but right now you're looking at me more...normal.",
        "Whoa. That's a little harsh.",
        "What is that supposed to mean?!",
        "You've always got a whole lot to say about your grand plans for the future...",
        "That's a lot to take in...you're not too far off though. I try to live life the way I want to. I wasn't that way when we first met, but I've changed since then. Nowadays, what you see is what you get.",
        "Well, I don't think I could live the way you do, but I admire you for sticking to it. You never let your burdens get you down. You try to push through them instead. If I'm being honest, I changed my mind about you a while back.",
        "You can be real critical of yourself, and you admit it when you make a mistake.",
        "I probably make twice as many mistakes as you, but I don't notice half of 'em! Hahaha!",
        "That it is! But it doesn't change what I promised before. I'm gonna keep fighting for you, Edelgard. Even if we don't live our lives the same way, I'll help cut a path through so you can follow safely behind!",
        "Yaaah! Urrraaah! I'm not finished with you! I. Am. Caspar! Hiiiyahhh!",
        "What's going on, Hubert? You need something?",
        "Uh, excuse me? What's that supposed to mean?",
        "I know. I do it on purpose. It's how I get fired up. That a problem for you? You scared?",
        "What are you talking about? It sounds like you might have a problem with me.",
        "Ooh, you sure do love to hear yourself talk.",
        "You really think I'm that stupid? I only shout when it's completely necessary. I don't do it all the time!",
        "Hey! Why don't you just shut up about it? I can control myself.",
        "I did it just for you, Hubert. Isn't that what you wanted? Weren't you the one who said my shouting would cause problems?",
        "Well, that was then. Recently my behavior... caused trouble. Just like you said it would. I was shouting the other day and some enemies heard. I pretty much gave our position away and left us open to attack. I mean, it turned out fine in the end, but someone could've died if things had played out differently. Anyway, I did some self-reflecting and realized that I probably shouldn't shout so much. A decision that I'm proud to say I came to all on my own.",
        "I'm sorry, what? That's the exact opposite of what you said before!",
        "What in the world are you talking about?",
        "I really don't get you, Hubert.",
        "YEEEAAAH! I'M BAAACK! IF YOU WANT ME TO SHOUT, THEN I'M GONNA SHOUT! I'M NOT EVEN GONNA THINK ABOUT IT! I KNEW YOU'D COME AROUND!",
        "Then I guess I'm gonna have to fight some guys while shouting! Hwahahaha!",
        "That settles that. And don't even think about brawling around here again!",
        "Hey, Ferdinand! Did you see that fight?",
        "Your fellow noble? I wasn't even thinking about nobility. That had nothing to do with it.",
        "I guess so? But it was more like instinct or something. I saw people acting out of line so I had to step in.",
        "I never have any idea what you're talking about. If someone's in trouble, you gotta help them out. Simple as that.",
        "Maybe all of this \"noble\" stuff just isn't for me—hey! Don't walk away when I'm talking to you!",
        "Ferdinand. Waiting for what?",
        "Righteous path—what? You have a problem with my \"path\" now? You think you're more \"righteous\" than me?",
        "Hey, now. I think you're underestimating me here. When the thief showed up, the old shopkeeper was so scared that he could barely stand. I didn't want the guy to pass out, so I had to stay calm while handling the situation. Rather than fighting, I gave my own money to the thief and told him to get out of there. Or else.",
        "The thief fell for it and left the shop. That's when I chased him down. I got my money back and gave the thief a good beating. He won't be back here anytime soon.",
        "Hold on! Now it's your turn. I heard a very interesting story about you recently.",
        "The way I heard it, you punched a foreign soldier. Right in the middle of town.",
        "Let's hear your version, then.",
        "Well done. Sounds exciting.",
        "So, that's what really happened. I just heard you snapped and attacked some noble's servant. I figured it was worth asking about.",
        "Is there something wrong with that? It sounds a little like something I would do.",
        "I think we're starting to rub off on each other. Always looking for a way to defend justice, and to lift each other up!",
        "You're looking pretty tired, Linhardt. I think you could use a little more of the fighting spirit!",
        "Enough? There's no such thing! You need as much as you can get it if you're going to train.",
        "Ha! I remember your father wasn't too happy about that. Our fathers actually got into a fight over it.",
        "I wish they'd just have it out already. One big fight to settle things. My father would win, obviously, but it would still be fun to watch.",
        "Pfft! Height advantage? What does that even mean?",
        "Whoever forces the other to submit wins. That's how fighting works. It has nothing to do with height!",
        "No, I don't get it. Now you're talking about limb length and reach? None of that matters when you're up close and brawling!",
        "If you've got something else to say, then come out and say it! Actually, forget this! I'll prove it to you myself.",
        "Some of those new knights look pretty tall. I'll fight one just for you!",
        "Ugh, they're all so strong... I couldn't land a single blow.",
        "Why am I having so much trouble fighting these tall guys? They're not even stronger than me? You've got to help me come up with a strategy, Linhardt.",
        "That's because your plans are always so complicated! But come on, I need your help.",
        "You already have a plan? You really are ready for anything. So, what is it?",
        "So, you're basically telling me to just...fight?",
        "The secret is the knees?",
        "Makes sense! That doesn't sound like my style though. I don't really wanna exploit a weakness.",
        "There's more? Fine. Tell me the rest.",
        "I won't argue with training. Let's go!",
        "It's been five years. You've got to me at least as strong as I am by now!",
        "C'mon! You've even got that height advantage you're always going on about. You're the perfect training partner for me. Quit stalling and let's go!",
        "All right, Linhardt! Come at me again!",
        "Huh? Hey! Get back here! Hmph! He got away...",
        "This is it. Today's my day. Caspar's day! Come get some!",
        "Hahaha! And that's how it's done!",
        "And then I got him — BAM! Right in the solar plexus! I really wish you coulda- Hey! Are you even listening? This is when it starts getting real good!",
        "You should be more excited! We finally won!",
        "Yeah! I couldn't have done it without your advice! You're a strategic genius, Linhardt!",
        "Whoa. I've never heard you compliment me before. I don't think I like it... Seriously though, I couldn't have done it without you! Like you said, I wouldn't give up on fighting, and I'm not gonna give up on this either!",
        "Are you saying you wanna escape from our friendship?",
        "Hah! You got that right! No one can break this bond! Even if we argue and but heads sometimes... We'll never have to fight it out, and that's a promise!",
        "Well, that makes sense.",
        "Definitely! And let's win this thing while we're at it!",
        "Oh! Hey, Bernadetta! What's going on?",
        "Help? I'm the one who came here for help. I guess I'll just take care of it myself. I can't believe I got hurt trying to break up someone else's fight. It's ridiculous! All I do is step in to calm them down, and the next thing you know they're both at my throat. Hey, you ever been in a fight?",
        "Uh, all right. That was easy enough. Not to be rude, but do you ever think that maybe your attitude makes you a little unapproachable? You should try stepping outside and socializing. I'm sure you'd make friends in no time if you didn't waste it all in here.",
        "Why wouldn't it be? Making friends is easy! This one time I even made friends with someone I'd just been in a fight with. I think it was the gorgeous view that did it. We really shared a moment... C'mon, let's go check it out!",
        "Calm down. I'm just gonna carry you outta here. Easy does it!",
        "And here we are! See? That wasn't so bad now, was it? And what about this view? Gorgeous, right?",
        "Hey now, don't go dying on me, Bernadetta. It's just the sun.",
        "Well, well. If it isn't Bernadetta! What brings you here?",
        "Don't leave yet, you just got here. Was there something you wanted to talk about?",
        "In town? Oh! You mean when all those thieves showed up. That was rough. I heard a bunch of people got robbed.",
        "Some thieves tried to carry you off?! Horrible! Absolutely horrible! Just tell me which way they went. I'm gonna—",
        "Wait! Don't go! What are you trying to ask me?",
        "Of course. Sorry. You have my full attention.",
        "The place I took you with the view? Oh! Right! OK, first you go out the monastery and— Actually, it's kinda tricky to explain. C'mon, I'll take you there again. But pay attention this time.",
        "Come on, Bernadetta! Open up! Why are you so mad at me? I have no clue what this is about, but I'm sorry!",
        "Uhh, no? I didn't do anything!",
        "What are you even talking about?",
        "What place?! Why won't you— OH! The place with the pretty view! Why are you mad about that?",
        "Again, why are you mad about that?",
        "I'm sorry. I didn't realize I... I was just exited to show it to you! Maybe I went a little overboard. I'm real sorry about all that...",
        "I definitely do, and I feel awful about it. What can I do to make it up to you? Anything you want! I wanna show you how seriously sorry I am!",
        "Anything!",
        "Sure, sure, of course. No problem. But... that was three things, not two.",
        "Ah! Oh, OK! Sorry, sorry! What's the other thing?",
        "All right, I can promise that. Seems a little strange though... Why do you care—",
        "Right! On it!",
        "Here we are! Look at that gorgeous sunset!",
        "Haha, this little bit of sunshine? You really gotta get outside more! From now on, I'm gonna take you to all sorts of different places! I promise I'll be gentle, and I promise I won't take anyone else. Just you and me, all right?",
        "Haha, what? Good one, Bernadetta...",
        "''' '''All right! Time for some more— Oh. Petra. Hi.",
        "Uh, yeah. Sure.",
        "Well, hey! Look at that! You pay more attention than I gave you credit for. I have been trying new training methods. They're definitely paying off. My movements are much sharper lately, more precise.",
        "All right. I mean, I guess we can give it a shot. Um, Petra.",
        "Uh, no. Never mind. Sorry, I was just... thinking about something else. Nothing at all! Let's train!",
        "No, no, no. It's really nothing. Don't worry about it.",
        "Ugh! Fine! We can talk about it if you insist. You can stop pretending like you don't know.",
        "About my father.",
        "No, not that. Well, it's kind of about that... I'm talking about when Dagda and Brigid invaded the Empire. My father led the Empire's army that fended off the invaders. Your father was in that battle. Did you really not know? My father killed yours.",
        "I just found out recently. I had no idea before then, but it's all I've been able to think about since...",
        "Petra? Damn it! What am I supposed to do now?",
        "Oh. Uh, right. Thanks.",
        "I'm impressed with how much stronger you've gotten too. More than I—",
        "Just hold on, Petra!",
        "It's your attitude! How can you act so casual around me? My father killed your father. You shouldn't be able to stand the sight of me! You actually hate me, right? That's fine. I can take it. I completely understand. Just be honest! Give it to me straight.",
        "If our roles were reversed, I don't think I'd be able to forgive you. I don't understand how you can—",
        "I don't need to worry? Impossible! I don't think I'll ever be—",
        "Of course not, I—",
        "Hey, Petra. How's training going?",
        "Good, good... At least things haven't gotten worse, right? Heh. So... did, uh... Did you hear what happened the other day? The professor really—",
        "Oh! Whoa! OK, there's no need for that!",
        "What?! I thought you said it wasn't a big deal! We're not our parents and all that!",
        "A deep wish... What are you talking about?!",
        "I see... So, you do hate me because of what happened, but... you still want to be my friend? You haven't stabbed me yet... so you obviously want me to live more than you want me to die... I hope?",
        "OK, that's a relief! I don't want to lose you either, and I definitely don't want to fight you. To be honest, if things were the other way around... I don't think I'd be able to forgive you. I'd hate you, and I'd hate myself for feeling that way.",
        "But you're not like that! You see me as your ally... and your friend. You had the chance to kill me, but you used it to show me that you want me to live. You really are an incredible person, Petra. I want to be more like you. I want to prove that I'm a good friend. I promise, you won't regret letting me live!",
        "I'd like that, Petra. From now on, we'll be more honest and open with each other.",
        "Hey, Ashe! What's with all the noise? Did something happen?",
        "Stealing from a monastery? What kind of monster would do such a thing? Come on! We gotta get that dirty thief!",
        "Capture? What are you talking about? Why bother? This is the kind of person who would steal from a monastery. We gotta take this guy out as soon as we see him. How do you expect to get rid of the evil in this world if that's how you're gonna treat it?",
        "You really don't get it, do you? If you let people get away with stuff like this, it's only gonna get worse. If we're gonna uphold justice, then we gotta stop evil. Simple as that.",
        "And you can't just hide behind your fancy words! You have to take action! You know what? Forget it. There's no point in arguing this with you. We're gonna have to fight this one out. Whoever wins gets to make the plan. Got it?",
        "We don't have time to take it easy! The thief is getting away and all you wanna do is talk and—",
        "Aw, come on! You hear that? You just cost me my chance!",
        "Come on, we can't waste time arguing about it like last time! We gotta catch the guy! There he is! Corner him, Ashe!",
        "Hah! You're not going anywhere, you dirty thief!",
        "I guess, but I didn't think our thief would be so...",
        "So, uhh... What do we do with him?",
        "You really think I'm gonna attack him? Why don't you try your genius plan instead? Go ahead, talk it out! Let the cat explain himself! I doubt you'll understand a word the guy says.",
        "Huh?",
        "Gah!",
        "Haha, he sure did!",
        "I'll teach him a lesson if we ever catch him again. I thought of a pretty good plan to show him the error of his ways.",
        "Is that a challenge? Well then, may the best plan win.",
        "Go on, eat up. Oh, wow. You're really going at it!",
        "Here he comes, right on time. The food's all ready to go! Huh? Ashe? What are you doing here?",
        "Feed? Well, I don't know what you're... wait. Did you say \"too\"? Is that what you're doing?",
        "I was just worried about the guy! I didn't want someone else to find him and hurt him. I figured it would be the best to watch out for him. You know me, defender of the helpless! More importantly though, what's your excuse?",
        "Yeah, I guess we're not... deep down.",
        "Oh yeah! I've got something good.",
        "Uhh.. Get what?",
        "Is that some dried fish and vegetables? Looks like someone's leftovers.",
        "I'm a defender of the helpless! You really think I'd steal some food for a cat? I got it by fighting an old guy in the dining hall! I won it fair and square!",
        "No, the old guy started a fight! Then I took his dinner as a prize! Aww, you love this meat, don't you? And you love when I fight, don't you?",
        "Hey there, Annette! What's with the sour face? Everything OK? I don't think I've ever seen you look so miserable!",
        "Sorry, sorry. You know I didn't mean it. Did something happen? You don't have to share if you don't want to, but I think talking it out might help.",
        "Not at all.",
        "Oh no. What happened?",
        "Wow, sounds more like art than cooking to me.",
        "I wouldn't worry about it too much. Accidents happen. It's not like you were trying to make a mess.",
        "Was anybody hurt?",
        "Well, there you go! No need to dwell on it and keep moping around. You had a bad day, but I'm sure you'll do better tomorrow.",
        "Uh...sure. Just as long as you're not making any new art projects.",
        "Up and at 'em, Annette! There you go!",
        "Calm down, you got nothing to worry about. They're fine! My men retrieved the rest of your unit. You're the one we've been worried about. How ya feeling? Are you hurt? You've got a pretty painful looking wound on your leg.",
        "If you say so... I gotta admit, I got the chills when I heard you were missing. Your soldiers told me what happened. I was only able to find you thanks to them. You've got a good troop there! You should be proud!",
        "What's wrong, Annette? Not feeling so good after all?",
        "What are you talking about? I don't know anyone around here who works harder than you. You put your all into your work and everyone knows it. Why do you think your soldiers are so loyal?",
        "There's no way they'd do so much for you if they didn't see it in you. C'mon, let's head back. I'll help you if you're having trouble walking. Your soldiers are worried about you. Go show 'em you're doing just fine!",
        "No problem! Just remember that it's OK to make mistakes, as long as you're learning from them!",
        "Well, hey there, Annette! What's on your mind?",
        "Nothing I can think of! Sometimes you just gotta mess up!",
        "Nah. No matter how much you prepare, you're always gonna make mistakes. All you can do is quit worrying and try your best!",
        "That's too bad. It's a great way to live. You worry about messing up, and all that worry makes you nervous, right? So being nervous on the battlefield is the reason you make mistakes you'd never make in training!",
        "Ugh! You gotta quit doubting yourself! It's not helping! You're obsessing about failures that haven't even happened! What's the point in that? Sometimes you're gonna mess up no matter how hard you train. That's life!",
        "Was I not clear on that? You just gotta deal with your mistakes when you make 'em!",
        "Haha, aww. Thanks, Annette! I think you're great too!",
        "That's the spirit! Let's get out there and train! I'll race you to the stables!",
        "Hey, Raphael. You here to train?",
        "That's probably... enough for today.",
        "You know... I really envy you, Raphael... You're huge!",
        "I'm not very big, but I've always wanted to be. That's why I train so much. I've grown a bit in the last five years, but I'm still not even close to you. I just don't know how to bulk up.",
        "Really? You gotta show me!",
        "Huh? You just led me to the dining hall.",
        "We're just gonna eat?",
        "I always thought I was a pretty big eater, but maybe I wasn't eating enough? Or not often enough?",
        "Let's do it! I'm gonna eat till I can't move!",
        "Yeah, Raphael. That's one way to put it.",
        "I haven't missed a day. The problem is that my body doesn't want to grow in the directions I want it to. I was hoping to get a little taller, but I seem to just be growing...wider. I don't think your methods are for me.",
        "What makes you say that?",
        "All right, Raphael. I think I see the problem now. I thought I envied the size of your body, but I was wrong. After hearing you say those nice things about me, I realized that I actually envy the size of your heart.",
        "That's right! I don't just need a bigger body, I need a bigger heart! Once I have a bigger heart, then maybe, just maybe, my body will start growing too!",
        "Now how do I increase the size of my heart? It didn't help with my body, but do you think eating will make my heart grow?",
        "I really don't want to get any wider though... I'm so conflicted... I guess there's only one way to find out. It's like you always say, \"when in doubt, go to the dining hall!\"",
        "Agh. That doesn't feel good at all. Why did he have to punch me so hard?",
        "Oh! Uh, hi, Hilda. I just got into a little fight. No big deal. I definitely won.",
        "No, no. That's really too much. Like I said, I'm fine.",
        "Huh? Maybe it's worse than I thought... Whatever. It can't hurt to have it looked at.",
        "Great! Thanks, Hilda. I had no idea you were so good at this.",
        "It's not like I go looking for fights. And I'm not always the one who starts them! There are just a lot of guys in this world who won't listen to reason. Somebody's gotta beat some sense into them!",
        "Maybe that's how you'd handle it, but I can't just look the other way.",
        "You really think that?",
        "Now that's a good point right there. I guess I could give this whole \"restraint\" thing a shot.",
        "Ugh. There they go, starting another fight! I'm just gonna march over and-",
        "Wait. No. I have to restrain myself.",
        "Hmmm. Urghhh. Gah! I can't do it! Hey! You! Stop right there!",
        "Hah! That takes care of that! Oh. Oh no. Were you watching just now?",
        "The, uh... the fight that just happened? The fight that I definitely didn't start! I've been trying to restrain myself like you said, and I've been so good about it too, but they pulled me in! I tried to keep back but — Ugh!",
        "OK! You got me! I can't restrain myself! I just don't have it in me. But the bad guys were dealt with, so it turned out fine, right?",
        "Really? You're not gonna tell me how disappointed you are and that I need to be better? I figured you'd be mad, but you're actually smiling.",
        "I was! I mean... Sometimes I just can't help myself and I gotta get out there, haha.",
        "Wait a minute. So you were watching! Why didn't you try and stop me?",
        "Smitten? Wow, you must really love a good fight. I gotta admit, that one was pretty good. I guess I love fighting too.",
        "You know, Hilda. I really appreciate how open-minded you are.",
        "People usually try to hold me back when I get into a fight. Not you though. I like that about you. What was it again? You like a good fight? Yeah, I remember it now...",
        "That can't be right. you complimented my fighting. Said you were smitten by it.",
        "That makes sense. I guess I am pretty impressive You're really amazing too, you know that?",
        "I think most people like to force their ideas on everyone else. They'll tell someone off it they don't like how the other person is living. Try to make them change, even if they don't want to. You're different though. You let people live however they want. There aren't a lot of people like you in the world.",
        "Come on. really?",
        "That's surprising, but I don't think you should let it bother you so much. You shouldn't let anyone change you, or else you'll end up losing the qualities that make you so great.",
        "Hey, Hilda. Can I ask you something?",
        "Well, you know that thing you do where you flirt with guys and get them to do stuff for you? Why don't you ever do that with me?",
        "Heh, you know, I just... Wait. \"Surprisingly\"? What's that supposed to mean?",
        "You really think I'm so heartless that I wouldn't be willing to help you out? I'd be happy to help! Depending on what it is you need.",
        "I guess that makes sense. Sorry I've been so oblivious to your needs... But why can't you just ask?",
        "Sure, but if your plan is to guilt someone into offering their help, isn't that the same? Or worse?",
        "I'm not sure I follow, but I like the way you live too. Not being tied down by anything or anyone sounds like a pretty easy life. I get that. If there's anything you really need help with though, don't be afraid to ask me. Sometimes you just can't afford to wait around for someone else to notice.",
        "Your room? Are you redecorating? Or moving out?",
        "I don't follow.",
        "Is that it? That's no problem at all!"

    "Catherine": [
        "Hm. I wonder why.",
        "Why does Lady Rhea give you special treatment? You're not particularly strong or good-looking. You seem exceedingly unremarkable. Not that I doubt you were a skilled mercenary. Shamir came from the same background. But she doesn't get nearly as much of Lady Rhea's attention. Besides, it'd be one thing if you got brought on as a knight. But a professorship? Unprecedented.",
        "Maybe it's because you're related to Jeralt. He was the leader of the Knights of Seiros, and probably the finest mercenary in all Fódlan. By the time I joined, he was gone, so I don't know him too well. But he's strong, right?",
        "Oh, come on! There can't be a soul in Fódlan who hasn't heard tales of the Blade Breaker! Maybe that's it. Jeralt used his influence to help you. But Lady Rhea wouldn't give you favorable treatment because of that. No, definitely not... There must be something more to you. OK, that settles it. I'm going to watch from afar, figure out what Lady Rhea could possibly see in you. Whatever it is, maybe I can copy it, so that she'll take a shine to me as well. And if I discover that your intentions are malicious, I'll cut you down. With relish.",
        "I was trying to catch you off-guard, but you managed to block it! Not too shabby, Professor!",
        "Oh, come on. Look at the blade I threw. It's just a wooden training sword. At worst, you could have gotten a bruise, or perhaps a splinter. Let's agree it was funny and move on.",
        "Besides, I knew you'd dodge in time. I told you before that I was going to observe you. Since then, I've been watching you. I know what you're capable of.",
        "I took steps to make myself invisible, so I could observe you without being detected. I hardly let you out of my sight. After extensive research, I've concluded that you really are first-rate. Your sword skills are impeccable; you're a gifted educator. You clearly love working with the students. Someone with all of your exceptional qualities should not exist. But here you are! At first, I thought Jeralt was the reason for Lady Rhea's interest in you. But no. Lady Rhea knew exactly what she was doing when she singled you out. Unfortunately, I can't hope to emulate you, let alone wield the Sword of the Creator. So my plan of imitating you for Lady Rhea's attention has come to nothing.",
        "** Part I: I didn't say that. I plan to give Lady Rhea a detailed report about what you're up to. Hopefully then I'll be in her good graces. Oh, and don't think you can avoid being watched. I won't let you out of my sight!",
        "Hiiiiyah! I will not yield! Yah! It's been awhile since I had such a close call. If not for you, Professor, I wouldn't have made it. I didn't expect to be ambushed on a simple scouting mission...",
        "I have to ask, Professor... What brought you here?",
        "Hm. So you came to protect me. I'm beginning to understand why your allies love you. These are selfish times. One doesn't expect to encounter selflessness. You're kind. In that respect, I'd say you're much like Lady Rhea.",
        "Of course. It's thanks to her kindness that I'm here today. I was an outlaw in Faerghus. She took me in and let me live here.",
        "Didn't I tell you? I was born into House Charon, in Faerghus. They used to call me Thunderstrike Cassandra. I was implicated in a plot to kill the king. It was a totally false accusation, of course. I had to flee the Kingdom, and the archbishop took me in.",
        "I used to be a student at the academy, so I knew I'd be safe here. Lady Rhea saved me once when I was a student, you know. I don't really remember what happened... I was badly injured and near death. Lady Rhea took care of me. She didn't mind getting dirty. She took my muddied, bloodied body into her arms... Since then, Lady Rhea has been my inspiration. I will always serve her, protect her... Love her. For some reason, when I think about Lady Rhea, your face comes to mind. You've become an important presence in my life.",
        "I wasn't expecting you to have a positive response. I'm not thrilled about it, personally... I am still going to keep my eye on you. Not so I can report to Lady Rhea though. Just because I want to.",
        "Sorry to bother you, Professor. I know you're busy.",
        "That's what I'm trying to figure out. I've always seen myself as a servant of Lady Rhea, not of the church.",
        "I suppose I could go back to Faerghus and take up the Charon name again... But that's not what I want. I'd rather not be tied down by my family name.",
        "It wouldn't feel right, falling back on knighthood simply because it's what I know. It would be different if I had a reason to continue being a knight...",
        "Well... If you told me you wanted me to remain a knight, that would be a good enough reason. Or if you said you wanted me to stay by your side forever. Or... if you said you wanted to get married. For example.",
        "Wait... Are you being serious?",
        "You are!",
        "But I'm Thunder Catherine, whose very name frightens little children. Who knows what I might do to you! I'm no good at cooking or sewing or anything remotely domestic. Why me?",
        "You love me.... I... I'm glad. As for me, I love you too. Deeply. I never expected things to turn out this way... But now that they have, I'm certain I wish to remain a knight... and stay by your side. Will you accept?",
        "'''Good! After all, swinging a sword has been the only life I've known. But from now on, the power of Thunderbrand is ours, not just mine. For now and forever, you can't escape me. I hope you're ready!'''",
        "Hm. I wonder why.",
        "Why does Lady Rhea give you special treatment? You're not particularly strong or good-looking. You seem exceedingly unremarkable. Not that I doubt you were a skilled mercenary. Shamir came from the same background. But she doesn't get nearly as much of Lady Rhea's attention. Besides, it'd be one thing if you got brought on as a knight. But a professorship? Unprecedented.",
        "Maybe it's because you're related to Jeralt. He was the leader of the Knights of Seiros, and probably the finest mercenary in all Fódlan. By the time I joined, he was gone, so I don't know him too well. But he's strong, right?",
        "Oh, come on! There can't be a soul in Fódlan who hasn't heard tales of the Blade Breaker! Maybe that's it. Jeralt used his influence to help you. But Lady Rhea wouldn't give you favorable treatment because of that. No, definitely not... There must be something more to you. OK, that settles it. I'm going to watch from afar, figure out what Lady Rhea could possibly see in you. Whatever it is, maybe I can copy it, so that she'll take a shine to me as well. And if I discover that your intentions are malicious, I'll cut you down. With relish.",
        "I was trying to catch you off-guard, but you managed to block it! Not too shabby, Professor!",
        "Oh, come on. Look at the blade I threw. It's just a wooden training sword. At worst, you could have gotten a bruise, or perhaps a splinter. Let's agree it was funny and move on.",
        "Besides, I knew you'd dodge in time. I told you before that I was going to observe you. Since then, I've been watching you. I know what you're capable of.",
        "I took steps to make myself invisible, so I could observe you without being detected. I hardly let you out of my sight. After extensive research, I've concluded that you really are first-rate. Your sword skills are impeccable; you're a gifted educator. You clearly love working with the students. Someone with all of your exceptional qualities should not exist. But here you are! At first, I thought Jeralt was the reason for Lady Rhea's interest in you. But no. Lady Rhea knew exactly what she was doing when she singled you out. Unfortunately, I can't hope to emulate you, let alone wield the Sword of the Creator. So my plan of imitating you for Lady Rhea's attention has come to nothing.",
        "Hiiiiyah! I will not yield! Yah! It's been awhile since I had such a close call. If not for you, Professor, I wouldn't have made it. I didn't expect to be ambushed on a simple scouting mission...",
        "I have to ask, Professor... What brought you here?",
        "Hm. So you came to protect me. I'm beginning to understand why your allies love you. These are selfish times. One doesn't expect to encounter selflessness. You're kind. In that respect, I'd say you're much like Lady Rhea.",

        "I wasn't expecting you to have a positive response. I'm not thrilled about it, personally... I am still going to keep my eye on you. Not so I can report to Lady Rhea though. Just because I want to.",
        "Hey there. At it again, are we? It feels like I see you training here every day.",
        "Heh. You said the same thing when you were little.",
        "I've been meaning to come and talk to you properly for a while now.",
        "You were just a little pipsqueak! You really have grown up, haven't you?",
        "Oh, don't look at me like that. I was thrown off by your haircut, that's all.",
        "My father did give me a stern reprimand for speaking so rudely to a prince. But then I never had a chance to apologize. I was always getting into trouble back then. Just like the incident in Duscur...",
        "No. I'm happy with the life I have. No offense, Your Highness, but I don't fight for king and country anymore. I fight for Lady Rhea.",
        "You're worried about my life as a fugitive from the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus... Don't worry about me. I'm here because I want to be. It suits me far better than the life I'd otherwise lead, as a noble lady of the Kingdom.",
        "How about you? You've never wanted to roam free?",
        "Ah, you're too serious for your own good. How'd you become such a stiff?",
        "Ha! If you can joke about it, there's hope for you yet.",
        "Another day, another training session, I see. You're quite dedicated. And practicing with the sword today. You weren't any good with it when you were little, as I recall.",
        "Lord Rodrigue mentioned it to me. He said you used to swing your sword so hard that you'd break it.",
        "Well, I can't just take your word for it, can I? Let's see what you've got! Well! I'm impressed. You're better than I expected.",
        "No need for false modesty. We fought as equals just now. You're strong, and your form is excellent. You're clearly an experienced fighter. But you're greedy. You can't be so impatient to win. It'll come at a grave cost.",
        "Ah, it returns—the formality, the stiffness. Anyway, after we're through here, I might head into town for some food. Care to join me?",
        "Of course you do. Never mind about my plans, then.",
        "Hm, you think so? I didn't want to push you to join me. We can just do it another day. I'll confess, I'm taking a shine to you. I'd like to talk to you more.",
        "Hey, hey, slow down! Where did all this come from? You're embarrassing me. That's enough chatter for now anyway. Let's get back to sparring. This time with lances.",
        "Right! Prepare yourself!",
        "That was delicious. Wow, I'm full. Nothing beats a big meal after a training session.",
        "OK, what's up? You seem distracted.",
        "No. I haven't even entertained the idea. My loyalty lies elsewhere. No matter what, I'm going to find Lady Rhea. That's what I'm fighting for. I'll defeat the Empire, and rescue Lady Rhea. That's what I'm fighting for.",
        "It's simple. I adore her. Lady Rhea isn't just kind, but strong, and courageous... I think she's a wonderful, beautiful person. More so than anyone else in the world.",
        "Hah! You can't. My reluctance to return to Faerghus isn't about you though. Ever since I met Lady Rhea, going back just hasn't been an option.",
        "Eh...",
        "You need someone who's like me, but more noble. You're so stern and serious all the time.",
        "Sorry, I'm not going back. Besides, my father is alive and well, fulfilling the duties of House Charon. I have plenty of capable brothers and sisters who can take over after him. I'll keep serving Lady Rhea here. And you'll bring the Kingdom together at the capital. We have to direct our talents wherever they're most useful and most needed. Right?",
        "Anyway! Early day tomorrow. Don't want to stay up too late. You better go to bed.",
        "What's wrong, Dimitri? Your swordplay's oddly sluggish today.",
        "If you were hungry, I'd get you something to eat. That's not the problem, though, it seems. It's not much fun fighting you when you're so far below your usual standards.",
        "Are you worried about something? Tell me.",
        "Yes. If we're both still alive.",
        "I suppose not. Garreg Mach and Fhirdiad are quite far apart.",
        "Wow, you sure know how to draw out a conversation. Just say what's on your mind!",
        "That's it? \"Return to the capital\"? Just like that, with no explanation?",
        "Yes. I've also told you that I'm devoted to the Knights of Seiros and wouldn't dream of leaving. It'd be one thing if you were asking me to return to my family. Why summon me to the capital?",
        "Oh, please! Don't waste your romantic words on me. Save them for a girl you really like.",
        "Is that so? Hah! I never imagined that brat with the silly haircut would try to woo me some day.",
        "You take yourself too seriously. But you're not selfish, even if you are a bit greedy with your sword. They do say you can tell who a person really is from the way they wield their sword. Maybe it's true.",
        "I'll think about coming back to the capital, OK? Some day. But as for now, don't you have something more important to worry about?",
        "Stop getting distracted by trivialities. Focus on what actually matters. We'll have plenty of time to flirt when the war's over.",
        "Is there something I can do for you, Ashe?",
        "This is quite an old letter. Where'd you find it?",
        "Hm, I see. It's one of the documents you collected.",
        "Hm.",
        "Ah...",
        "Christophe was a good man—maybe too good. It wasn't in his nature to mistrust people. So when the Western Church told him that Lady Rhea had to die for the goddess's sake, or the world's, he went along with it.",
        "Christophe and I were friends. We were in the Blue Lion House together at the academy.",
        "No. If there was another option, I'd have chosen it. But he was foolish. He went along with the plan to assassinate Lady Rhea. I wasn't motivated by a personal grudge. I had no choice but to turn him in. That much is true.",
        "\"Lying\" is a strong word. The world was in chaos, and the church did what it had to. If people had known about the threat to Lady Rhea's life, the panic would only have worsened.",
        "You can choose what to believe. All I know is, I let him die. And that's something I can never change. Now, if you'll excuse me.",
        "What's wrong, Ashe? Why are you standing there?",
        "Do you hate me?",
        "Why don't you take a swing at me? I bet that'll make you feel better.",
        "Don't just stand there with that timid look on your face. Come at me!",
        "This isn't about avenging the dead. It's about taking revenge for yourself. It's how survivors move on. What will you do, Ashe? You're welcome to stare at your feet for the rest of your life.",
        "Ah, that look in our eye. I like it!",
        "Come on! Put your back into it!",
        "Yes, Ashe?",
        "Don't be a fool. You decide for yourself what's right and what's wrong. I believe Lady Rhea is right. So I won't allow anyone to bring her harm.",
        "I couldn't. I'll never forget that day... When they took him, all I could do was stand there. I had to persuade myself, over and over under my breath, \"This is the right thing to do.\" If I hadn't, I wouldn't have been able to stand there. I would've cried out. I'm still persuading myself even now. I probably will be for the rest of my life. If I let myself regret what happened, he will have died for no reason.",
        "Uncertainty is weakness. Someday, Ashe, you'll have to make up your mind. You know who I am. What will you do about it?",
        "... Wow, you've gotten much better. You're not doubting yourself anymore. It's like your state of mind is completely different. What changed?",
        "Please do. Maybe this is a chance to resolve our dispute and move on.",
        "Of course. Your brother's blood is on my hands. It wouldn't be easy for anyone in your position to feel forgiving. If someone said it was easy, I would probably give 'em a smack in the face. You may never be able to forgive me, no matter how hard you try. I'm prepared to accept that. It's my duty.",
        "That's rather poetic.",
        "Sorry, didn't mean to make light of it.",
        "I think meeting you has been good for me too. Different people have different morals. They won't always agree on what's right and what's wrong. Maybe that's obvious. But it's something I think about when I'm talking to you.",
        "Sure, but I won't do all the talking. It'll be dull if you don't tell me about yourself too.",
        "OK! Let's chat over a nice, tasty meal. My treat.",
        "Hurry up, or I'll eat all the food!",
        "Thank you! Yes, let's.",
        "Let me guess. You're going to ask why you're so bad at predicting my attacks.",
        "It's probably because you're a straightforward, honest person.",
        "Right. Well, I take that anticipation and turn it against you. I use my eyes and the tilt of my sword to mislead you. Catching your opponent off-guard is the trick to staying alive in combat. You've got to keep yourself alive if you want to protect Lady Rhea, right?",
        "You flatter me.",
        "Admire me to your heart's content, but I'm-",
        "My what now? Oh, you're far too straitlaced to be my squire.",
        "Hm. All right, then. Why not? Let's start by teaching you how to flirt with handsome men!",
        "Nah, I was just kidding. I wish I knew how to flirt with handsome men. Instead, let's teach you to lighten up.",
        "All right, then. Enough sparring for today?",
        "I must say, you've gotten good at seeing through my tricks. I can't mislead you so easily anymore.",
        "But in hand-to-hand combat, your form needs work. On the battlefield, even if you lose your weapon, you can't ever stop fighting. Sink your teeth into their throats, kick 'em where it hurts. Do whatever it takes to survive.",
        "Not on the battlefield. I've never been in such a dire situation that I needed to. But at the tavern, loads of times! With a well-aimed boot, I've brought many a man to his knees.",
        "My point is, you can't hesitate to use dirty tactics. You have to grit your teeth and fight back. War isn't as pretty as it's made out to be, in all those poems and songs. Sometimes, even as a knight, you have to do things that you might think are beneath you. You might even have to let innocent bystanders die. Are you prepared for that, Ingrid? Do you really want to be a knight, knowing what it entails?",
        "You've got me wrong. I'm loyal to the archbishop, but only up to a point. I'd do anything in the world for Lady Rhea... except die. If she asked me to die for her, I wouldn't. Does that sound like a contradiction? Very well. That's just who I am.",
        "You will someday. Maybe not for a while, but you will. In the meantime, just don't die. OK?",
        "Oh, it's you. Yes?",
        "I don't appreciate your tone. Are you implying I swiped it off someone?",
        "That's none of your business.",
        "Let's say I was a nobody, with no Relic, no Crest. I would still be me, wouldn't I? That's not to say lineage counts for nothing. It just doesn't count as much as how you live your life, and what you live for. Or, let's say I was descended from some noble house. Would that change how you treat me?",
        "You're so narrow-minded! Tied down by foolish, antiquated notions.",
        "Wow. You really think nobles are better than everyone else, don't you?",
        "You pay so much attention to people's lineage and status that you have no idea who they actually are. Even if I was from the prestigious House Whatever, I would never associate with a blowhard like you!",
        "Lorenz, are you spying on me? That's not very noble.",
        "You just don't let up! I didn't inherit my sword skills, Lorenz. I trained. I earned them. One's lineage does not affect one's talent or tenacity, to be sure.",
        "Sure. And besides keeping the peace, what are the nobility's other duties?",
        "Whether or not it's their duty, if they don't use their power wisely, the people will revolt.",
        "\"The nobility must be held accountable,\" hm? I never thought I'd find myself agreeing with you. Maybe you're not as bad as I thought. In fact, I'll let you in on a secret. I am from a noble family, House Charon of Faerghus. I used to be known as Cassandra Rubens Charon. Perhaps you've heard that name before?",
        "So people say. However, I didn't do anything wrong. Anyway, how do you rate me now? On one hand, I am a noble. But I'm also a fugitive.",
        "Hah! So you'd like to suss me out with your sword. Sure, I'll take you on.",
        "Let's put the match on hold for now, Lorenz. Or if you can't wait, we'll say you won.",
        "You weren't using a Relic either. If you had been, you would have won easily. Even without it, you're stronger than I expected. You seem to be fighting more intensely than usual.",
        "Are you saying you fought more ably because you had a sense of purpose?",
        "Interesting...",
        "That might be an exaggeration. I've done some things I'm not proud of.",
        "Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm no longer a noble.",
        "I don't want to be a \"true noble.\" I won't be tied down by any stuffy idea of nobility. Although, if this is your way of flirting with me, perhaps I can be persuaded otherwise.",
        "Tell me, Lorenz. Do you often woo noble women? As a \"true noble,\" I must be an ideal target for a fellow like you.",
        "Lighten up! I'm just teasing. You're clearly not ready to woo me.",
        "You're more open-minded than you used to be. But you're still so hung up on status and lineage. If you became a more tolerant person, maybe it would work out. What matters isn't someone's blood. It's what they want, what they fear, what they accomplish. When you understand that, let me know, and I might just fall for you.",
        "It was so sunny this morning, but now it's absolutely pouring.",
        "Don't worry about it. I was just passing by and thought I could help. I know how frustrating it is to have your newly dried clothes soaked by rain.",
        "What's wrong? We managed to keep all of the clothes dried, didn't we?",
        "Ah, I see. That probably is your fault.",
        "You have a Crest of Charon, don't you?",
        "I can just tell. I have a Crest of Charon too. And I've noticed that, whenever I need dry weather, there's rain. Don't you think it's our Crests making the rain fall upon us?",
        "Well, I don't know how true it is. There are only the two of us, which is a pretty small sample of people.",
        "Now, there's an idea!",
        "Lysithea, do you have a moment?",
        "I was thinking about the time we talked about our Crests bringing bad weather.",
        "Joking aside, each Crest is unique in how it impacts the bearer's life. I've seen more than my share of Crest-bearers, after all. Some of them bore Crests of Charon, like us... Some even bore Crests of Gloucester.",
        "I'm not a Crest scholar. I don't know all the details... But I have a knack for guessing a person's Crest just by looking at them.",
        "Forgive me, but... Do you have two Crests?",
        "You don't have to tell me. I mean, it shouldn't even be possible to bear two Crests. So if you do have two, you must be sitting on some major secrets.",
        "Of course. Everyone has things they would rather not talk about. For all you know, Catherine's not my real name. Maybe I'm an outlaw, on the run from my homeland!",
        "I was kidding! Though who knows, maybe there is some truth in it. My point is, no matter what secrets we're keeping, I'm still me and you're still you. I do worry a little about you. You never seem to let your guard down around other people. That can't be easy. You know, it's important for you to relax once in a while.",
        "That's easy! Just gab with your friends about something pointless and the stress will fade away! I'm always happy to chat, if you're interested.",
        "I just feel a certain kinship with you. We both have Crests of Charon, and we both have secrets we can't share with anyone.",
        "Good! You can feel comfortable with me. Since we have the same Crest, we're basically sisters.",
        "Well, don't you just say the cutest things. That's my little sister for you!",
        "That's enough. You're done for today.",
        "Are you feeling pain anywhere, Leonie?",
        "Why are you apologizing?",
        "... Do you know what I meant when I said, \"You're done for today\"?",
        "No. It wasn't about your physical strength. I could tell that you didn't have the will to keep fighting.",
        "\"No matter what I do, I can't win.\" Isn't that what you were thinking?",
        "If you think you can't win, you won't. Perhaps you already knew that.",
        "But, never assume that you'll win. That is, don't underestimate your foe. At all times, you have to keep a clear head, to make split-second decisions. In battle, mistakes are deadly.",
        "If you put it like that... I'll fight barehanded, and I won't use my Crest. Think you can win? Do your worst.  Oh dear. I might have overdone it there. But I believe in her. I would be doing her a disservice if I pulled any punches. It's Leonie, after all! She'll be back on her feet and charging at me before I know it.",
        "Hrah! Hyah! Ryaaaah!",
        "Kyah! Nyah! Chaaah!",
        "Oh! A spectator. If you want to ogle, you ought to be a little less conspicuous.",
        "Yes. I'm simulating prolonged combat. Fighting for a long time requires a whole different set of skills. If you can't handle it in training, you'll certainly be doomed against the real thing.",
        "You've been in your share of battles. I'm sure you have some sense of what it takes. A brutal, protracted clash in open marshland, neither side retreating. In that situation, what will you do? Your survival depends on decisions you make in the moment.",
        "Most importantly, don't give up. Don't start thinking about how you might lose, or might die. Focus on surviving, on winning.",
        "That's the spirit, Leonie! Though I'm not planning on losing either, you know.",
        "You remind me of myself when I was young. I would become so angry at my own weakness. I feel strangely nostalgic, seeing that same anger in you... H-Huh? Where'd that girl go?",
        "Hm? Oh yes, I'm fine. Never better.",
        "You worry too much. If they saw me in action, the wounds themselves would cower!",
        "Me, \"gravely injured\"? When did that happen?",
        "Are you sure? All I remember is cutting down monsters left and right.",
        "Oh! That was when that happened! Finally, it all fits together. Lady Rhea looking after me—now that I remember clearly. That was the first time she ever spoke to me. I was lying on the ground, caked in mud, and she gently picked me up, even stroked my hair... The emotions were so overpowering that they must have just cleared away my memory of the whole incident. So, it was during the monster hunt! Thanks, Seteth. That's been bothering me for ages.",
        "Come to think of it, Lady Rhea hasn't healed me since then. Maybe if I get wounded badly enough, I'll have that honor again!",
        "We've got to find Lady Rhea, and then maybe someday she'll honor me like that again...",
        "Hey Seteth, I've been meaning to ask you. What is your relationship with Lady Rhea?",
        "You're much closer to her than anyone else in the entire church. Certainly you're a good, upstanding person, but I can't help but feel there's something more to it.",
        "A companion?",
        "Hmm, companion, huh? A companion. I guess that does sound about right, now that you say it. Though, I'll confess to being quite jealous! Not many people can call themselves companions of Lady Rhea.",
        "Oh, come on. You must trust that she feels the same about you.",
        "A companion in fighting for the archbishop?",
        "You're right, they are. I suppose you and I could be considered companions in that sense.",
        "Whoa there, what's all this now? Flattery won't win you any prizes with me, Seteth.",
        "Oh good, we're back in familiar territory—with you admonishing me. Don't worry, I'll be careful. I'll always try to live up to your expectations. So don't expect too much, or you'll wear me out!",
        "Hiiiiiiyah! Take that, you goons! And that!",
        "Urgh... Are you all right?",
        "All those times you scolded me, and now you get yourself all beaten up.To think, nearly getting yourself killed in a minor skirmish like this one!",
        "What's gotten into you?",
        "Don't play dumb. I was supposed to patrol this area, not you. What are you even doing here?",
        "Seteth, this isn't like you bumped into me on a stroll around town. Nobody passes through a battlefield!",
        "What?",
        "And you were injured in the process. I don't know what to say... Seteth. I didn't realize you worried so much about my safety. I apologize...and I'm grateful. I guess we really are companions.",
        "I... I...",
        "All right. You've made your feelings clear. When you say it like that, I can't refuse. I'm sorry for making you worry all the time. I'll be more careful. I promise.",
        "Hello, Gilbert! Done with your drills? That's a shame. I was just about to ask if you'd spar with me. What bad timing.",
        "The arm's all healed now, thanks for asking! Besides, I have to keep exercising it, or the muscle will waste away. Here I am, ready to spar!",
        "It's not the first time I've gotten a scratch in battle. You needn't be concerned. Besides, eventually I'll lose this whole body, not just an arm. As a knight, I have to come to terms with the fact that I will die someday.",
        "Is something wrong? It's not like you to blurt that out where anyone could overhear.",
        "It's not like anyone is looking for me in Garreg Mach. But still. Since we both have secrets to hide, we'd do well to watch our mouths. Right, Gustave?",
        "Always so formal, eh? Still, I humbly accept your kind offer, good sir. Let's see how your lance skills fare against me!",
        "Why'd you summon me so formally? Not going to confess your love, I hope.",
        "That's...a bit ominous. What is it?",
        "Ah. That's what this is about.",
        "I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss my friends and family back in Faerghus. But no, I'm not going back. The person I used to be no longer exists. The life of a noble, tied down by rules and etiquette? No thanks. Not for me. My future is here, with the Knights of Seiros, as Thunder Catherine.",
        "So why did you ask?",
        "I do not.",
        "You think I'm just fulfilling my duty, huh? I'm not as virtuous as you make me out to be. I fight because I want to. That's it.",
        "It seems we've come to an agreement, then. So what are we doing standing around here chatting?",
        "Now we're talking! Oh, also, Gilbert... You look much better now that you have some fire in your eyes.",
        "C'mon, just one, please. I'll pay for it next time.",
        "Ugh... It's been a long day. I just need a little drink.",
        "Alois, what're you doing?",
        "Thanks, Alois. Are you sure you don't regret doing that?",
        "Nah, that's generous of you, but I couldn't accept. You're a good guy, Alois, you know that? Not only paying my tab, but offering to buy me a drink too.",
        "Did he ever pay you back for bailing him out?",
        "That sounds like him. And to be honest, it... well, sounds like you too. You're probably not bothered when it comes to my debt, but I want you to know I'll pay it back.",
        "You're hopeless! But you know what, Alois? That's how I like you. Next time a con artist tries to bilk you, I'll be sure to save your backside!",
        "...And he said, \"I don't even have a horse!\" Pretty funny story, huh?",
        "What is it, Shamir? You're not laughing! Didn't you think it was funny?",
        "So then, laugh! You could stand to be a little friendlier, you know.",
        "What do you mean, \"need to be\"? Friendship isn't about obligation. You could try being a bit warmer. Like when I first met you, I took the time to introduce myself an make friendly conversation... And you just said, \"Hi, I'm Shamir.\" I remember thinking that you wouldn't be easy to get along with.",
        "Well, that's a bit harsh. Did you really think that?",
        "Hmph. But you changed your mind when you saw me in action?",
        "Well, even though you had zero charm, you did a nice job of supporting me. Now I know that you'll always have my back. In fact, maybe I should take it easy and let you handle all the fighting.",
        "We make a pretty good team. At any rate, we're bound together, so we better try to get along! Don't you think, partner?",
        "Before long, all of the church's enemies will have been destroyed.",
        "Lady Rhea. You're the only one in the knights who doesn't address her with the proper respect. It's not just that I worship Lady Rhea. I respect her, admire her, revere her...",
        "Shamir. If you were anyone else, I would cut you down for saying that. She saved your life.",
        "You never change. You're so stubborn.",
        "I don't plan on getting killed. And it's not that I'm wearing blinders-I'm just focused. I've devoted my heart to Lady Rhea. She's the reason I wield my sword.",
        "So my death would \"cause you trouble\"?",
        "Let's give it a rest. There's no point in arguing.",
        "I understand. I think we can both agree on that.",
        "Hey.",
        "You don't know what I was going to say!",
        "Fine, then. We don't need to talk about it.",
        "...Actually-",
        "Sorry, you go first.",
        "OK. Let's talk about it. I will be faithful to Lady Rhea until I die. If I had to choose between you and her, I would choose her every time. I assume that disqualifies me from being your partner.",
        "Well, no. I'm quite fond of being alive. I don't intend to sacrifice my life, either. If it came down to you or me, I'd choose...",
        "What's wrong?",
        "Maybe someday you'll have to take a path that diverges from ours. What if we went to war with your country?",
        "Maybe I shouldn't be thinking like that. The future is one of the great mysteries of life.",
        "You got that right! I'm the best there is.",
        "You're safe. I'm so relieved.",
        "I'm sorry. I've been thinking about the last time we talked.",
        "I've been a little afraid since then. Afraid that you might quit the knights.",
        "I kinda thought so too. I realized that I might actually lose you someday. And that's...scarier than I expected. I've never felt this way about anyone other than Lady Rhea.",
        "I guess so. I have many brothers and sisters in arms, but you're my only partner. I know you have my back, so I can focus on the battle in front of me.",
        "Thank you. I lost someone too. I thought we'd be together forever, but our lives went in different directions. Relationships are so fragile.",
        "Ah! Sorry, partner. Hope I didn't worry you. I lost hold of myself there.",
        "Next move? What do you mean?",
        "That was just...unexpected! If you'll excuse me, I need some fresh air..."

    "Claude": [
        "Hey, Teach. I see you're as stony-faced as usual. Hmm. I can't tell if you're feeling resigned or if you're just lost in thought. Or maybe you simply don't care about anything that's going on. Oh... Sorry. I really didn't mean to be rude. I just find you fascinating. Actually, there's something I'd like to talk to you about. Can you spare some time?",
        "Speaking of, before you came here, you were a mercenary, right? Always getting your hands dirty on the battlefield and whatnot? It's a bit unusual that you suddenly decided to become a teacher one day. In any case, I've been meaning to ask. Did your father teach you how to fight?",
        "It must have been hard on your mother when you followed in your father's footsteps and became a mercenary too.",
        "I see. I suppose you grew up moving from battlefield to battlefield with your father then. You know, for someone who's right around the same age as me, you certainly have an unusual amount of composure. I guess it's only natural that you'd be different from young nobles who grew up in the lap of luxury.",
        "Ha! Well, even so, I am heir to House Riegan, the leading family of the Alliance. But I didn't exactly grow up in luxury like most people of noble blood. Hey, maybe that's why you and I get along so well. Folks like us should stick together. As house leader, I'll do all I can to help you out. We can start by making time for more little chats like this.",
        "Hey, Teach! Hold on a minute, OK? I'm gonna have this cleared up in no time.",
        "Aaand...done! What do you think of that, Teach? A colorless, odorless poison! Say...care to test it out for me?",
        "I hear your silent question, Teach. Why the delay? That's so it can be used even if you don't have access to the target when you need the poison to take effect. Um, naturally, I have no immediate plans for this stuff! I suppose I just felt like broadening the ol' horizons a bit. When devising schemes, it's best to have as many options at your disposal as possible. Expanding those options is kind of a hobby for me.",
        "Well, I grew up in an environment where it was necessary to think that way. It's like I told you before, I wasn't born into a life of luxury. Ever since I was a child, I've always been seen as...different from those around me. An outsider of sorts. I've been resented and hated. There have even been attempts on my life. I don't believe I've earned such treatment, but that's how it goes for people like me.",
        "Thanks, Teach. You know, in many ways I'm just a normal person like everyone else. But in the right environment, anyone could be seen as an outsider. It can become...overwhelming. That's why I kept running. Kept fighting. As a kid I spent a lot of time licking my wounds and coming up with schemes, trying to keep my nose out of trouble while plotting against my enemies. My parents always told me I wouldn't grow stronger if I didn't learn to fight my own battles. And so, in the end, I did. And I grew up to be as independent and self-reliant as my parents always wished for me to be. Lucky me, right?",
        "If anyone knows what I'm talking about, it must be you. Eh, Teach? I get the feeling you know what it's like to be an outsider. The moment I first laid eyes on you, I knew you weren't like everyone else. People don't care for folks like that... You'd do well to watch your back.",
        "On the bright side, that's also part of the reason that I find you so interesting.",
        "Hey, Teach. Do you believe in gods? I don't necessarily mean the goddess of the Seiros religion. Just... gods in general. Do you believe that incredible beings who control the fates of all really exist?",
        "I've always hated the idea of praying to a god. After all, you can only really rely on yourself. I still believe that. You can't win a war by leaving your fate in the hands of a god. Only tangible facts can really decide a war. Which side has the most troops, the best tactics, the better organization and planning. Of course, miracles can happen. And by that, I mean things that are completely outside of your control. Things that only seem to add up if you believe in the concept of fate... Things like... well, like meeting you, for example.",
        "You just seem sort of... impossible. I think everyone would agree with that. You can wield the Sword of the Creator, you're a tactical genius, and you have this strange ability to earn the trust of anyone you cross paths with. Before I met you, I never imagined that it was possible for someone like you to exist.",
        "And yet, now that I know you, your presence in my life has quickly become invaluable. In fact, it's hard to imagine making my dreams come true without your help. Because of that, I can't believe for a second that our meeting was just a coincidence. That means it must have been fate. Maybe it was a miracle. Or maybe some god empathized with me and my dreams.",
        "Again, I don't mean the goddess of Fódlan. Though... I suppose it may be hard for you to grasp what I'm talking about. People all over the world have different ideas about who or what the gods are, right? Even in distant lands across the ocean or over the mountains...",
        "They have gods who see the world as a whole, who don't care about Fódlan's borders... Who don't meddle in our affairs. Who don't grant life or take it away. And maybe, sometimes, they'll make a miracle happen. A god like that... That's the sort of god I think I could believe in.",
        "I'm just speaking my mind, that's all. I think people should be free to believe in whatever gods they want. If a person believes in a god and that god becomes a support system to them, that's a good thing. That's what a god should be. Anyway... Maybe I've overstepped it.",
        "In any case, let's keep this conversation between the two of us, yeah?",
        "Oh, hey there. What are you doing up at this hour?",
        "At times like this, I just gaze up at the stars to clear my head. I've been that way since I was a kid. Looking up at the big, starry sky makes my dreams feel small... which makes it feel like I can actually make them come true. I didn't believe in gods when I was a kid. Maybe that's because the night sky took their place for me.",
        "Hey, Teach... Will you talk with me a while? I bet you've figured this out, but I wasn't born in Fódlan. Where I come from, the people of Fódlan are looked down on as cowards. Technically, that cowardice runs in my veins. On my mother's side, anyway. That's why the people who were around me when I was growing up thought of me as an outsider. But I don't believe the people of Fódlan are cowards. That kind of perspective is just based on ignorance.",
        "The person from Fódlan who I know best is my mother. She fell in love with a man from the wrong side of the border and had the guts to leave home to pursue that love. I always threw that in the faces of anyone who tried to make a fool of me. My mother is proof the people of Fódlan aren't all cowards.",
        "Just saying that doesn't achieve anything, though. I need to destroy the prejudices that have taken root in my homeland. That's why I came here, to see Fódlan with my own eyes. I thought I might be able to find a new perspective that could help me change things.",
        "And what did I find? That the people here view anyone who's an outsider as a beast of sorts. I was shocked. Even though our cultures and beliefs are completely different, our two lands have that much in common. That's when I realized the only way to change things is to bring the whole world together and start anew. That's the dream I've been working towards since I first entered the Officers Academy five years ago. To unify the Alliance, and then all of Fódlan, and to bring a new set of values to this new land of mine... After that, I'd expand that vision to the rest of the world. Break down the walls and let a new perspective come rushing in! Start all over!",
        "Do you think that's just a crazy pipe dream? Or a brilliant ambition?",
        "Not too long ago, I would have said that it was too much for me to accomplish on my own. But that's not how I feel anymore. And that's because I have you on my side now. Lately, I've spent a lot of time thinking about how I wouldn't have made it this far without you. You and me, Teach. We can go anywhere. Do anything. I hope you'll always walk in step with me... At least until the day comes when we can look out at the peaceful world we've built. Together.",
        "Hey, Teach. I see you're as stony-faced as usual. Hmm. I can't tell if you're feeling resigned or if you're just lost in thought.

At least until the day comes when we can look out at the peaceful world we've built. Together.",
        "Sorry for calling you out here like this. I wanted to talk, just the two of us. First of all, I wanted to say thank you for all your hard work. It seems like our long struggle may finally be coming to an end.",
        "The way forward will certainly be rough. Right now, Fódlan is like a newborn. Frail and easily upset. If we don't create a new ruling system soon, the Empire and Kingdom will descend into chaos. The coronation ceremony is the first step. Only then will Fódlan truly be a single, united land. I'm sorry that I won't be by your side at such an important event, but I'm certain you'll do great.",
        "I must return to my homeland. As for ruling this new, unified land... Well, I'll leave that to you.",
        "The Fódlan blood that flows in my veins... I've made use of it as best I could. Now I've got to use my other bloodline to change my homeland for the better. I have royal connections there too, insignificant as they may be. It's time for me to struggle all over again and see what good I can do. If I don't change things in both Fódlan and the lands beyond, I'll never set eyes on the kind of world I've dreamed of creating.",
        "You're the successor Rhea appointed, aren't you? And now you're also the hero who saved Fódlan. All those weak people who have nothing to cling to but their goddess... They'll rely on you just like they used to rely on Rhea. You'll be a leader all who are struggling to survive in war-torn lands can look up to. And I... I want a ruler who can lay down a new set of values for the people. Values that don't exclude anyone for being different. I know it's a lot to ask. But you're the only one who can do it.",
        "I have something else to ask. Please... I hope you'll accept this. When I first saw you wield the Sword of the Creator, I wanted to use your power to my advantage. I wanted to use you to make my dream of a new world come true. But before long, I realized what I really wanted was to see that new world... with you by my side.",
        "I still feel that way, you know. I always will. That's why I have to leave. But nothing will stop me from coming back. There's no way I'm gonna let you go. You know that, don't you?",
        "Thank you... For everything. I'll be back before you know it. We'll only be apart for a short while. And now... I'm off to cross Fódlan's Throat.",
        "I love you. With everything I am. And the next time we see each other... it will be at the dawn of a whole new world. A peaceful, happy world.",
        "This looks like an ideal place to take a nap. Only one way to know for sure. Ahhh, and there's a nice breeze today too...",
        "Huh?!",
        "Is that... Petra? Where are you?",
        "Were you up in that tree the whole time? I couldn't feel your presence at all! Amazing!",
        "Your logic is sound, I'll give you that. But how is one supposed to get up there without losing the sleepies from the effort?",
        "I see. That makes a certain kind of sense. But it's not as relaxing as a good ground sleep.",
        "That is way more thought than I had hoped to give this nap of mine. But I'm not one to give up before even trying. Here goes nothing!",
        "I... I can do this...",
        "Nope, not a weakness... I just... How do I... ARGH!",
        "I think that's enough for today. This might sound like an excuse, but we don't have a lot of tall trees where I grew up. This is all new to me.",
        "You won that round, tree.",
        "Hey there, Petra!",
        "Where else? Wait, I'll meet you down there...",
        "True! Which is exactly why I worked like a madman to devise a new climbing technique.",
        "What can I say, I just... OK, so I may have cheated a little. By using my bow to shoot a rope over a branch. Or a few branches. Or all of the branches. But once I got up there and hauled up the ropes, it was the same result as if I'd climbed it your way!",
        "You're right. I didn't harm the tree at all. I'm surprised that impressed you.",
        "I see. I take it the people of Brigid have a close relationship with nature, then?",
        "True. The people of Fódlan believe everything is a blessing from the goddess. They've forgotten to be grateful to nature too. Nature gives us life. Sustains us. Without it, we couldn't breathe. Couldn't live. It's everything. It's fine to pray to the goddess, but we have to respect nature too. Don't you think?",
        "You and me both.",
        "The training equipment needed maintenance, so I thought I'd give it a good cleaning and some oil.",
        "If you intend to use something a lot, it's on you to take good care of it.",
        "Thanks, but to be honest, I don't think being a noble really has anything to do with anything. Nobles and commoners are all equal here. We're all buddies. Even you do chores, don't you? Social rank doesn't matter when you put your life in each other's hands. I like that about this place.",
        "I know just what you mean. It's not like the ancestors of the nobility or royalty were selected by the goddess herself, after all. What does origin or status matter? In the grand scheme of things, we're all just insignificant mortals. Nobility isn't a matter of birthright alone. At least, not in my eyes.",
        "Thanks, and same to you. You're a princess of Brigid, right? If I'm a strange noble, you are too!",
        "Ha! An abnormality, am I? Gentleman that I am, I'll go ahead and take that as a compliment.",
        "I'll remember that. But for now, this equipment isn't going to clean itself.",
        "You're an abnormality, Princess. A wonderful abnormality.",
        "Hey, Petra! Are you there?",
        "Oh! I didn't actually think you'd be here.",
        "It seemed best to call out as soon as I arrived. I can never tell when you're here and it wouldn't be good for my heart if you just dropped in from outta nowhere.",
        "Is that a fact? I'm honored. Anyway, I see you beat me here today. Say, Petra... Wouldn't it be great if, no matter bad the war gets, at least this place stayed peaceful?",
        "I like this tree too. It feels like it's always welcoming and reliable.",
        "Whoa! Where did that come from? You sly minx, have you been searching for a suitor all this time?",
        "Well, you are a princess, so it makes sense that you have obligations.",
        "So you just need to find a man who meets your expectations? That could be tricky...",
        "Oh? And who's the lucky fellow?",
        "I see. Do you think he can give you the kind of future you deserve?",
        "Tie up?! Well... I'm sure the lucky man will learn to accept his fate one way or another! Besides, I doubt any man would reject a proposal from a catch like you.",
        "Huh?",
        "I saw the whole ritual, yes. You have a gift, Annette. I could watch that all day. In fact... I just might.",
        "Sure, sure, it can be my secret serenade, if you so please. But tell me... You were born in Faerghus, right?",
        "I thought so. You're really talented, you know. It's been a while since I heard a song like that. One that stirs me to my very soul.",
        "I never, ever exaggerate. In fact, it reminded me of rituals we have back where I grew up. We'd gather around a blazing fire and spend the whole night caught up in song and dance. Not unlike what you just demonstrated. Really, the dance I'm thinking of is exactly like the one you just did. We'd scream like beasts and then jump up and roll around. It's freeing, isn't it?",
        "Even better than your angelic voice were your lyrics. I can't even begin to fathom the deep meaning they contain, but maybe if we talk about it...",
        "Oh, I get it. It's the sort of thing you have to figure out for yourself. OK, don't tell me. Give me time. I'll work it out.",
        "Oh... Have you already watered the plants? Sorry, I'm just realizing it was supposed to be my turn this week.",
        "OK, see you later then. ♪ Creepity creeep... ♪",
        "Hi Annette. Looks like some tasty food you've got there. Mind if I join you?",
        "Very. I got caught up thinking about your song. I find it really makes the time fly.",
        "Alas, I cannot! That song is engraved on my soul. The lyrics...they echo in my brain, begging to be understood. Those words represent the cry of a poor soul who died in anguish... Is that it? That's it, isn't it?",
        "A land that's dark and frigidly cold... That could only mean the underworld. In my search for truth, I read up on the old rituals of the eastern regions of Faerghus. Those who died with regret are thought to end up in an underworld of sorts. Somewhere cold. Somewhere dark. Somewhere...creepy. To escape from their bitter limbo, they did their way up through the earth, trying to find the surface...or the light in other words. And so they creep about endlessly in the cold dirt of the underworld, clinging to their hopeless desire... Creepity creep, Annette. Creepity creep.",
        "So? Was I right or was I right?",
        "Huh. Now that I think about it...the melody and dance didn't really match the weight of the lyrics.",
        "Damn. That is good stuff. OK, maybe I read too much into it. Actually, now that you've explained, it really is a nice little song. Creepity creep... The gentle journey from the ground to the surface. I love it.",
        "Not at all. Oh! But that reminds me. I was so inspired by Creepity Creep that I made up some lyrics of my own. I've been nonchalantly carrying them around with me hoping to run into you. Would you mind taking a look?",
        "Oh, Annette. Sweet Annette. This time it's your turn to decipher its meaning. Let me know when you've figured it out!",
        "Huh? Sure! So, you managed to work through the labyrinth of my melodic poetry, then?",
        "Hey, that's pretty close for being completely wrong. It's not actually about me. It's about you, Annette. It's a song about your single-minded march through life.",
        "Of course! You know, about how you mess up and make a big fuss about stuff sometimes, but you're always looking ahead and striving. I just wanted to capture your pleasant, fidgety, fussy nature in a song.",
        "Of course I'm saying something nice! I'm so happy I get to be friends with someone like you. Everyone's really uplifted by your cheerful attitude, your refusal to give up, and that boisterous nature of yours.",
        "I couldn't agree more! And once you've finished, you should perform it for everyone. You're a fine dancer, after all!",
        "You drive a hard bargain. And if this performance is just for me, maybe I can coax you into letting me hear some of your other songs?",
        "I have never been more on board with anything in my entire life!",
        "I'll be the judge of that, and I can tell just by their descriptions that I'm right to be excited.",
        "I'm honored to be the exception, as well as your number one fan!",
        "Hm? What's on your mind, Ingrid? Actually, it it's something troublesome, can it wait a bit? I am positively exhausted today, so I was gonna turn in early. Don't try to stop me, you hear?",
        "Rising with the dawn and setting with the sun...Isn't that how a life is meant to be lived?",
        "And how would you know that? You haven't been peeking into my room every morning, right? I'll have you know I like to rise early for my daily meditation.",
        "You need to relax, Ingrid. Deep breaths, OK? A yawn can't hurt, I swear it. Really, you'd better get a hold on that attitude of yours, otherwise that pretty face is going to get all twisted up with angry lines. Guys don't like gals who are always griping at them. Try a smile every now and then. Here, let's practice. On three. One... Two... Three!",
        "Yeesh.",
        "Um. OK.",
        "Wow. Somebody needs to teach that girl to lighten up.",
        "Ingrid! Hello...",
        "Listen... I know you and I don't always get along. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry if my way of being is upsetting to you.",
        "Huh. Am I really similar to this friend of yours?",
        "Well now! I'll take that as a compliment.",
        "Hmmm. OK, I have to ask you something. But only if you promise not to show me your angry lines again. Doesn't that straitlaced personality of yours make life harder than it needs to be? I feel like there are plenty of people who'd like to get to know you better, but who are scared off by your... well, intense attitude.",
        "Really. I'd say that especially applies to most of the folks you go around giving lectures to. We're all friends here, Ingrid. We all trust each other with our very lives on the battlefield. Shouldn't we try to accept each other?",
        "I sure do. Besides, with a cute face like yours, I bet you could win over anyone if you just threw out a smile now and then.",
        "Oh, another lecture. I see you took my words to heart. Look, let's just call a truce, shall we? How about we agree that we could both learn something from our chat today? If you'll make an effort to smile more, I'll try my best to set a better example for everyone.",
        "And it's perhaps equally wild to ask an ice block like you to melt. But let's give it a try. What do you say?",
        "Ah, hello, Ingrid! A good day to you!",
        "You put in a fine performance in training today! I must redouble my own effort!",
        "By the by, do you have a moment to spare? I have been meaning to ask for your input on some new strategies.",
        "But of course. I value your skills more highly than most any other!",
        "OK, time out! Listen, Ingrid... Do you really have to say \"oh goodness\" every couple of seconds?",
        "What? Do I sound that strange? I thought I was acting earnest and industrious.",
        "Sheesh! Have you looked in a mirror lately? You're the one who's been walking around like Queen Uptight.",
        "Look, this was fresh and fun for a while, but... Maybe it's time we called it quits. Acting like this isn't us. We're just going to make everyone think we've gone mad.",
        "Ha, well, thanks for saying that. I think I liked you better when you were a bit pricklier too. I've gone so long without hearing one of your lectures, I'm almost starting to miss them.",
        "Uh, I didn't mean you need to go all out or anything. A little restraint would still be nice.",
        "Ooh... I think I'm coming down with a stomachache. We'll talk later, OK? OK! Seeya!",
        "Hi, Ingrid. That was a great training session today, wasn't it?",
        "Things have been pretty busy lately, though. I hope you're taking the time to rest whenever you have the chance.",
        "I've finally got a free day tomorrow, so I was planning to sleep through the morning and laze around all day...",
        "Ingrid... Will you just stop it already? Are you still doing that schtick?",
        "Are you feeling all right? You're acting so...demure. It's kind of creeping me out.",
        "Bah! You switched back!",
        "Ah... Right. I'm sorry. I guess that was kind of insensitive.",
        "I'm... Suddenly I'm feeling dizzy. Sooo dizzy. We'll have to talk about this later.",
        "There is no best approach!",
        "I told you before, didn't I? You're better off as your normal, prickly self. I don't mind getting lectured by you. So keep on doing that from time to time, OK? Just maybe not all of the time. Anyway. Ooh, the dizziness... Bye!",
        "Well, if it isn't Lorenz!",
        "Oh, naturally. After all, I really do adore the Garreg Mach Monastery.",
        "Lorenz, control yourself. Let's not start throwing around baseless accusations. It's not proper. This monastery is packed with a thousand years of history. Well, five years shy of a thousand, if we're going for accuracy. Those pillars, these walls, even the floor... They've all seen more than we can possibly imagine. Our distant ancestors may have walked these halls. Doesn't that excite you?",
        "If I weren't truly of House Riegan descent, how do you imagine I acquired my Crest?",
        "Well, that's what I came here to hone, after all. I can only hope that you will assent to instruct me in the art of snobbery, Professor Lorenz!",
        "Sheesh, that guy. He just can't be reasoned with.",
        "Hello to you too, Lorenz. And you'll have to be more specific. The Alliance is always bickering over one thing or another.",
        "If you please one noble, another will only gripe. No matter what happens, there will always be conflict.",
        "It's not as if the threat of Almyra to the east has proven all that threatening of late.",
        "Calm yourself. I am well aware that the financial situation of House Edmund is quite exceptional. However, what you fail to realize is that they are lacking in troops. They're not lying when they say they don't have that many to spare. As it were, the Almyrans have been nothing but peaceful since we refortified Fódlan's Locket. Are you aware that Margrave Edmund paid the majority of the costs for those repairs?",
        "In fact, it's largely thanks to the skilled craftsmen he assembled that the fortress is now so impregnable. I, for one, wouldn't want to attack a fortress as formidable as that.",
        "Well, well. And here I thought he only cared about status... Still, if someone like him really came to lead the Alliance, it would not bode well for Almyra.",
        "The earth nurtures the trees, and the trees bear fruit... It's the earth itself that gives us all life... Oh, Fódlan! Land of plenty! Bless us with the gift of delicious food.",
        "Bah! Oh... It's just you, Lorenz.",
        "Ouch! You don't hold back, do you? I didn't know you were so particular about poetry. Ha! maybe you have a secret poetry collection of your own hidden somewhere.",
        "Of course you zero in on that detail. You really are a Fódlan noble through and through.",
        "I'm not quite the same, no. Though noble blood flows within me, it can't change who I am at heart.",
        "Listen, Lorenz. You had ambitions of becoming the Alliance's ruler, didn't you? Would you like to try that for real? If you really want it, I wouldn't mind giving up my position.",
        "I'm not joking around. I've been thinking it for a while now. I originally thought you were like a fox drawn in by the deer of the Alliance. But I was wrong. You're no thoughtless predator. You're trying to properly train the deer around you. Isn't that right?",
        "A compliment? From you? That's about as rare as a deer standing on its hind legs and doing a jig.",
        "The future of the Alliance, eh? You really are devoted to your cause.",
        "Heh, I welcome the idea. It means I can feel safe vanishing whenever I see fit.",
        "Ha! First you compliment me, and now you're worrying about me? What have you done with the real Lorenz?! No, I'm not going to die. I'm tougher than I look. Besides... This war isn't just for the Alliance anymore. It's going to decide the fate of all Fódlan. It would be cruel to leave you with the burden of uniting all of Fódlan by yourself. Don't you think?",
        "Well, well! I guess I shouldn't take Lorenz of the famous House Gloucester so lightly! Really, though... Don't you go dying on me either, Lorenz. We're going to need men like you in the age to come.",
        "Hey, Raphael. That's quite a load you've got there.",
        "Aren't those trips usually for food supplies? Why did you pick up a bunch of spears and gauntlets as well?",
        "I see. And those books?",
        "Right. And that desk?",
        "Of course. Now, this is just a friendly observation, but I see surprisingly little of the food supplies we actually need.",
        "Raphael... I appreciate the thought, but you can't get so carried away with helping out like that. You helped us all right out of dinner. And now that I've seen your struggle, I have no choice but to join in this vicious cycle of charity. Here, I'll lend you a hand.",
        "You insult me! And no, I can't. I'll only carry the books and offer my support as you handle the rest.",
        "Hey, Raphael. This scene... why is it oddly familiar?",
        "But isn't your goal to become a knight? Running errands isn't exactly a knight's job.",
        "Well, you're not wrong, but I think most people would consider that only a small part of a knight's duty. A knight's main function is to fight and defend, don't you think? That said, I'll agree that helping anyone and everyone who needs it makes you a remarkably virtuous person, which is even better.",
        "I... Yes? I suppose so? I, for one, would certainly look for virtue in any knight that I recruited.",
        "Absolutely. If I somehow actually manage to become the head of my house, that is. I can't see into the future, but you have my word that I'll do all I can to help make your dream a reality. That is, if you're actually able to let somebody help you out, rather than helping out the whole world by yourself.",
        "You were praying so fervently, I didn't want to interrupt.",
        "No? What then?",
        "Were you now? Fascinating! Please, go on.",
        "So, you were pondering the existence of the goddess, then?",
        "They probably hope to rake in more followers by glorifying the goddess as much as possible. That would be why the church tends to quietly shove all of their more questionable records under some secret rug somewhere.",
        "What the goddess... looks like? Well, I suppose if she really exists, she probably looks a lot like us. In fact, she probably wouldn't be so different from that old woman working here in the dining hall.",
        "How rude of you, Ignatz! I'm sure that old woman was lovely back in her day.",
        "Hey, Ignatz. Getting lost in your imagination again?",
        "The goddess, you mean?",
        "Nah, you're fine. If I had the chance to meet the goddess, I certainly wouldn't say no. Especially your version of the goddess, eh? A total looker, isn't that right?",
        "Too true. No doubt an incomparable beauty, that one.",
        "Well, don't mind me. You go ahead and get some good praying in. If the goddess appears, you let me know, OK?",
        "It'll be way better if I'm there too. I'm saying this for your benefit, Ignatz.",
        "Imagine an incomparable beauty standing before you. Do you really think you'll be able to remain calm?",
        "But if I'm there, I can smooth things over. Have a nice chat, invite her to tea. Everything a goddess deserves.",
        "Of course it does. Now get on with it. Pray like you've never prayed before!",
        "Hey there. Still studying, are we? Isn't it past your bedtime?",
        "Ah, but if you don't get your sleep, you'll never going to grow big and strong!",
        "Whoa, there! I'm not trying to treat you like a child, I promise. This is me treating you like... like a princess! Now, come along, princess. Brush your teeth and get yourself ready for bed. I could read you a story, if that helps?",
        "If a child and a princess are out, what's left? Should I treat you as a noble hero? Draw your sword, Lysithea! If you wish to continue studying, you must first defeat me in battle!",
        "Come now! Face me like the hero of legend that you are!",
        "Ok, ok. I can take a hint. But in all seriousness, you shouldn't neglect your sleep. You'll fall ill if you push yourself too hard. Oh, and just so you know... I heard a rumor that this library is haunted.",
        "It's probably not true. Right? Right. Anyhow, I'm off to bed. Good night!",
        "Heh, no matter how she tries to hide it, she's still a young girl at heart.",
        "As you can see, if we were to face an enemy on this terrain, I would go here... and you would go here.",
        "Huh? I'm not sure that's the best idea. Take a closer look at this map. See, there's a graveyard over here. Might run into some of those ghosts you hate so much.",
        "Easy there! I'm sorry, OK? Just don't start blasting off any spells in here.",
        "Actually, I see you as more than an equal. There's no questioning the power you wield. And I was being serious about the formation just now. The bit about the ghosts was just me having fun with you. Or...trying to? You're so smart, I figured you'd catch on to that right away. But back to the formation... Can you see why I arranged it like I did?",
        "The area I want you to guard requires the ability to adapt to an ever-changing situation. Who else could I trust with such a difficult task? You're my best bet for something like that.",
        "Think back to the times we've fought together. When have I ever treated like a child on the battlefield? I depend on you, Lysithea. I value you power almost as much as I do Teach's.",
        "I swear to you on all of Fódlan. I like to have my fun, but I wouldn't joke about something like that. I consider you a valued ally. I'll stop now, before I inevitably drift back into teasing you again. Just know that I meant every word, OK?",
        "Lysithea, are you up late studying again?",
        "Look, you don't need to work yourself so hard. You're already as skilled as they come. There aren't many people out there who can match you. Everyone knows that.",
        "Why would you of all people feel pressured?",
        "When I met with Count Ordelia before, he said you were his pride and joy. But he also said his only concern was that you might be pushing yourself too hard. If you really want to make your parents happy, surely you should start by taking care of yourself.",
        "Then it's settled. Get some rest. Save your energy for tomorrow's battle.",
        "Oh, really? Does that mean you won't get mad if I treat you like a child from now on?",
        "Hey, just think about it for a second. You're the only one in the world I treat like this. That means you're a pretty special person to me.",
        "Take it however you like. Or maybe the thought is too much for a kiddo like you..",
        "Gah! Don't do anything you might regret! I don't want to be turned to dust!",
        "Well, that's good of you. All joking aside, go get yourself some shut-eye, ok? After all, if you don't hurry up, the boogeyman might come out and EAT YOU!",
        "Hmm...",
        "Hm? Oh, Marianne! Have the gods taken pity on my lost soul and revealed a sign to me?",
        "I've been researching the 10 Elites of Fódlan, but I can't tell fact from fiction... Anyhow, what can I help you with?",
        "Ah, right you are. Honestly, I'd resigned myself to never seeing it again. It's a keepsake from my uncle, who's passed on. If I'd truly lost it, my grandfather would have had my head. Thanks for returning it to me, Marianne. You saved my tail.",
        "No, I think that's enough researching for today. Why don't you join me for a nice chat?",
        "Sounds awfully lonely to only talk to those whom you have business with. Do you really dislike talking to people that much?",
        "No need to apologize. We'll figure it out as we go. Tell me, are you like this with your father too? Within the Alliance, Margrave Edmund is prone to debate. With a father like that, I would have thought...",
        "Oh, is he? I didn't know. Where were you born?",
        "She's hiding something, that much is clear. But that just makes me all the more desperate to know her secrets!",
        "Marianne... Please accept my apologies for my behavior yesterday.",
        "Asking you about your family like that was pretty insensitive of me. No matter how curious I am, that's no way to treat someone. I'm sorry.",
        "If not people... then with who? Unpeople? Nonpeople?",
        "I was actually joking, but... now I'm mystified. Who is it you like to talk to?",
        "Ah, of course! Good ol' Dorte. And does he understand what you tell him?",
        "Sounds like a complainer, that Dorte. But let's table this fascinating discussion for just a moment. Now that we've gotten in some small talk, I'd like to know what you're hiding. You are hiding something, right? Your lineage, perhaps?",
        "If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. If it's all just idle gossip, that's fine too. But if it's something silly like, \"my ancestors were cursed, therefore I'm cursed,\" you should know that I won't accept that nonsense. That sort of thinking is stupid, and that's all there is to it. Say your ancestors were thieves. Does that make you a thief, even if you've never stolen a thing? Of course not.",
        "People certainly are born with burdens... She's right about that. But, Marianne... Don't you know that you can choose not to carry them?",
        "Hi, Marianne!",
        "Sorry, I know you're in the middle of an important discussion with Dorte, but could I talk to you?",
        "It's about this thing you think you're burdened with. I've tried to guess what it is.",
        "There's no reason to feel uncomfortable. It's not like I plan on saying it aloud. But if my guess is correct, there's something I want to tell you. Will you hear me out?",
        "Once upon a time, in a faraway place...",
        "Just listen. Once upon a time, in a faraway place, there was a young boy. This boy came from a despised lineage. In short, his mother was a daughter of the enemy. So the young boy was treated horribly by everyone around him. He hadn't done anything wrong. Everyone hated him simply for existing. Yelling, fighting back, explaining himself... Nothing he did could change his situation. When he was finally old enough, he ran far away from home. He escaped.",
        "Thing is, after he ran away, he still found himself in the very same position. People in the outside world hated him for where he came from.",
        "The boy thought he had no place to go. All he could do was destroy the boundary between the inside and outside worlds.",
        "Right. If there was no outside and inside, just one side to share, then the people wouldn't have a reason to hate him anymore, right? It wouldn't be easy, but if he managed it, he could shrug off that burden.",
        "The point is, people are born with burdens to carry. That much is undeniable. But whether they bind us or we cast them aside... that's up to us. So I think you should try to cast yours aside, Marianne. Put that heavy burden down. It's time.",
        "It's OK. I'm here for you. We're the same... And I can help you.",
        "Hey! Did you see that, Dorte? Your friend just smiled at me!",
        "Let's do that. And when we're free, we can change the whole world.",
        "Huh? Are you actually reading, Hilda? I thought you hated studying.",
        "Your brother, huh? Isn't he known as a great general of the Alliance? A true beacon of —",
        "Uh oh, better not let your brother hear you say that! It would break his fraternal heart! But all joking aside, it sounds like he really cares for you.",
        "Ah, the Almyrans. The \"eastern menace,\" as they're often called. i did hear your brother had fought them a number of times. In fact, I hear he's even gone toe-to-toe with Nader, the great Almyran warrior.",
        "A pain? Any celebration is something to be enjoyed! Celebration puts smiles on faces faster than anything. I'm sure even you at least congratulated him, right? A smile from you would surely mean the world to your brother.",
        "That's not far from the truth, you know. Why do you think the Almyrans have been so quiet lately? They're wary of your brother. If House Goneril of the border were a bunch of weaklings, the Almyrans would have invaded Fódlan a long time ago.",
        "Well, I am heir to the leading house of the Alliance. I'm privy to all kinds of information, whether I like it or not.",
        "Oh, I disagree. I'd let you grasp me any day. My hand, my heart, even my neck. But if you want to know all my secrets... you'll have to bare yours as well.",
        "What are you writing there, Hilda? Wait, let me guess. You're replying to one of your brother's letters, right?",
        "Well, that's a fine thing to do, regardless of your reasons. As for me, it's been far too long since I've written to my parents...",
        "Not quite. He's still alive and kicking...as far as I know. The late duke who died in an accident was my uncle.",
        "He's quite the extravagant character. When I was a kid, he used to tie me to a horse and drag me around.",
        "In all fairness, I was quite a little brat. The horse thing sounds worse than it is. There's a sort of trick to it...",
        "Gods, no. She'd just laugh right along with him. If my father is extravagant, my mother's more like a warrior goddess or..maybe a demon queen. This one time, she got into an argument with my combat instructor and wound up in a full-on fistfight with the guy. What's more? She won! My instructor was a mighty warrior, undefeated in a hundred battles, but even he was no match for her.",
        "True, but she was the kind of woman to elope with the man she loved and throw it all away. Not your average duchess at all.",
        "It's not a question of can. It's a question of will. Even someone like you, who generally despises effort, would pull out all the stops for something you really care about. Isn't that right?",
        "Hey, that was a compliment! Anyhow, I look forward to the day when something inspires you try your absolute hardest. It will be something to behold.",
        "OK then... How about an old story from a foreign land that my dad told me when I was a kid? Once upon a time, there was a white camel that got separated from his herd...",
        "Was that story really worth bawling your eyes out over?",
        "You know, I never thought much of it until today... But seeing you bawling like that, I do appreciate it a little more now.",
        "Well, you're always fake-crying, aren't you? Getting all misty-eyed to make people think you're a delicate flower.",
        "Claim what you like, but I can spot real tears from fake tears any day of the week. Fess up.",
        "How's that?",
        "Well? Good one, Hilda. You hit me right in the gut. I guess you're right. I'm not so different from you in that way. But how did you come to realize that? Have you been watching me that closely?",
        "Nope—no can do. Forgetting isn't something this crafty brain of mine is capable of. Besides, my eyes have a tendency to wander in your direction too. How else do you think I found out about your fake crying?",
        "Say, Hilda... Once everything's settled down, do you want to come meet my parents? I mean, don't get the wrong idea. You just seem interested in my family. Besides, you've opened up to me quite a bit, but I still haven't let you in on my own secrets. If you meet my parents, I think you'll understand. Though it might come as a bit of a surprise.",
        "Well then, if neither of us changes our minds before the opportunity presents itself... Let's agree to go visit my home together.",
        "True... That might be a tough nut to crack. As tough as Fódlan's Locket...",
        "Is the water supposed to be this cold? Argh! My hand just slipped again...",
        "Sorry! I'm sorry! OK?",
        "Another fine mess I've gotten myself into.",
        "The student whose turn it was to do the dishes today was ill, so I volunteered to take his place. The dining hall lady was on my case the whole time for breaking plates and getting water everywhere. Actually, not everywhere. Mostly on myself. It was just one big mess. It wore me right out too. I could really use a nap about now.",
        "Being noble or common doesn't have anything to do with washing dishes.",
        "I'm honored you acknowledge my greatness. And I'm rather fond of your blunt way of praising a person's strengths too.",
        "You say you can't figure people out, but what you said just now was pretty shrewd. It's wise not to just trust appearance alone.",
        "Ahh... I see your point.",
        "Hey, Leonie! What are you up to?",
        "You were hunting? Is the dining hall that short on food supplies?",
        "I suppose so. You're from a family of hunters, right? Well, there's no shortage of prey to hunt around here.",
        "Eh, I dunno. I'm more inclined to thank the bountiful earth than the goddess for such things. The goddess may offer spiritual guidance, but she doesn't fill our bellies, that's for sure.",
        "Leonie... Whose grace do you suppose humans live by? The goddess? The nobility? I'd say it's neither. It's the endless bounty of this magnificent land that gives us life.",
        "I said she gives spiritual support, didn't I? I wouldn't go as far as to say she's wholly unnecessary. But in Almyra, Dagda, Brigid, and plenty of other places, they don't believe in the goddess... Nature is a blessing that knows nothing of borders. The goddess is the goddess, and the earth is the earth. They should both be revered for what they are.",
        "Look, this is just my personal opinion. If you truly believe that everything depends on the goddess of Seiros, that's your—",
        "I knew a wild girl like you would be able to get behind an idea like that.",
        "Hey... You know, this kind fo talk could be viewed as heresy if it was public.",
        "Winning is always the goal. At any rate, I've done everything I can to prepare.",
        "I don't doubt it. But however strong they are, it's no more than a Fódlan concern. Who knows how far this world extends beyond the boundaries of Fódlan. Talk of strength or weakness doesn't amount to much when it's only to relation to a tiny corner of the world.",
        "Exactly. It's nothing more than an internal quarrel amongst the people of Fódlan.",
        "The way you think—that changes the way you see things. Common sense never tells the whole story. It's similar to what we were talking about before. About how you need to doubt yourself first.",
        "Do you really want to know?",
        "Ah, but I'm afraid now isn't the time. When this war is won, I'll tell you all about it. It'll be easier for me to show you than to tell you.",
        "It's quite a distance. You'll start to appreciate how big the world is if you go.",
        "Yes, it's a promise. But first... Let's win this war and leave it far behind us.",
        "Flayn? Are you looking for something in particular?",
        "Right. Well, there should be regional records somewhere around here...",
        "Light reading? What do you mean by that?",
        "Ah. I see what you're getting at. Try asking a traveling merchant. I hear they keep stocks of, uh, books like that. As for here, I don't think you're going to find much aside from a bunch of stuffy records. We do get new books donated on a fairly regular basis, but then Seteth... Well, you know.",
        "Apparently he directly approves every book before it's allowed to grace these shelves. You know, to make sure nothing \"inappropriate\" gets through.",
        "Why were you looking for those sorts of books anyway?",
        "I had a feeling that might be the case. Sounds like Seteth.",
        "Without a doubt. It's obvious that you're his whole world, for better or worse. By the way, I've been wondering. Are you two from a noble family?",
        "You've clearly had a rather high-class upbringing, and both of you have Crests. That can only mean you come from a prominent bloodline, right?",
        "So...your refined way of speaking isn't because of your upbringing?",
        "Well... Look, don't worry too much about it. I'm probably just overthinking things. Probably...",
        "Hi, Flayn. Have the Four Saints caught your fancy?",
        "I see. In any case, do you mind if I ask you a little something? It's about your family's origin.",
        "Aw, but when you try to change to subject like that, it drives me mad with curiosity! That said, taking a secret by force isn't my style. That's why I've devised a different approach. Relentless nagging.",
        "I thought it might be something like that. Oh well. Guess I'd better give up trying to get you to tell me yourself. Instead...why don't I tell you about the theory I've come up with?",
        "I did a bit of investigating into the Crests that you and Seteth bear. Seteth's is the Major Crest of Cichol, and yours is the Major Crest of Cethleann.",
        "Oh, I just took a peek at some records by a renowned Crest scholar. I'd rather not say any more than that. Anyway, my point is that I don't think I've ever heard of two siblings each bearing the Major Crests of a pair of saints. If the legends are true, then Saint Cichol was Saint Cethleann's father, wasn't he? Which means, if you and Seteth were the descendants of Saint Cethleann... That would explain how you two came to possess Cichol and Cethleann's Crests!",
        "That about sums it up.",
        "Sure, sure, but the possibilities are endless. It's not like legends are known for their accuracy. But based on your reaction, I guess I'm probably following a bad lead here.",
        "Hello, Flayn. Isn't it about time you told me the truth?",
        "Who you really are. Villains are after you for your blood. There's no doubt that you're someone special. And that's why Seteth is always worrying about you so much, right?",
        "But just what makes that blood of yours so special? More than anything I've been wanting to find out Teach's true identity, but yours is bothering me just as much. Somehow I can't seem to stop thinking about you. It's almost like a crush. I have a crush on your secrets, sweet Flayn!",
        "I've tried asking Seteth, but there's no sign of him budging on the issue. At this point, I guess I just need better bargaining skills. How about this... If you tell me the truth, I'll do anything you say.  At this point, I guess I just need better bargaining skills. How about this... If you tell me the truth, I'll do anything you say.",
        "What's that?",
        "That's real nice of you and all, but I think if I could come up with the truth, I'd be able to tell from your reaction anyway. You're not great at hiding your emotions, after all.",
        "Now that's a request I wasn't expecting!",
        "I see... Well, that's an interesting turn of events. Looks like we both have a little crush on our hands, eh? I hope the day comes when we can talk freely about both of our identities...",
        "Hey there, Flayn. Looks like Seteth is as overprotective as ever.",
        "Listen, Flayn. Before I take a stab at your true identity, there's something I want to ask.",
        "Seteth is your father... Isn't he?",
        "I've been thinking about this for a while. And my latest theory doesn't make sense otherwise. That overprotective attitude of his... It seems like more than just sibling concern. More like a father protecting his only daughter.",
        "They're both pretty clingy, sure, but even they are willing to let their sisters live their own lives.  He's pretty clingy, sure, but even he's willing to let her live her own life.  Whereas Seteth... There's something more at play there. An entirely different dynamic.",
        "Even taking into account your special blood and the people targeting you because of it... I feel like Seteth has devoted his whole being to you. Like only a father would.",
        "Ha! As if he'd tell me anything even if I did. Though maybe if I tried to trick a reaction out of him... I could try calling out \"Daddy!\" from behind him when he least expects it... Nah, he'd probably kill me if I tried that. Not a good idea.",
        "Hey now, don't joke about that. That's something that should be done properly, when the right time comes...",
        "Well, you never know what the future holds. But forget that for now, I want to talk about—",
        "Ahhh, there's really no better place for my midday nap than under the shade of a nice, big tree...The twittering of the little birds...Hmm, it's like they're singing a lullaby just for me...BAH! Is that a dagger?! Am I being ambushed?!",
        "Shamir! Was this your doing? Talk about unfriendly...Another inch and you would have sliced my handsome nose clean off my roguishly beautiful face!",
        "You know...if you wanted to give me a talking to, you could have done so with your words instead. That's how most people do the talking thing.",
        "Wh-what then—a prank? That's not better! I thought we were under attack. I could have died from the shock.",
        "Is that... Riiight. There's a poor spider impaled on it.",
        "Yikes. I guess this little guy is more vicious than he looks.",
        "Ah. So you saved me from a certain doom. Well, in that case, I'm sorry for questioning your motives. I promise to repay the favor someday.",
        "Wow. So that's what the greatest sniper of all the knights is capable of. Absolutely incredible...",
        "Impressive as ever! It's always satisfying to see such skill in motion.",
        "Sure, but I hear there isn't a knight out there who can match your skill at reconnaissance and infiltration missions.",
        "Ooh, so violent! Why would you jump to that conclusion?",
        "Sorry to disappoint, but I didn't come to request an assassination. I just want to talk.",
        "Of course. You've piqued my interest for a while now. A little birdie told me you were born in Dagda. Is that true? That's pretty far away, beyond even Brigid in the west. So...what brought you to Fódlan?",
        "I see. I'm surprised they didn't take you as their prisoner.",
        "Yeah, of course you do. Still, with your particular skill set, couldn't you make your way back to Dagda whenever you please?",
        "Where you belong, eh? That's heavy stuff. I wonder if this is where I really belong...",
        "Ha! Hm. Not bad.",
        "Shamir? What a rare treat for you to start a conversation for a change!",
        "It's not possible you came to ask for my help with something. Could it be you want to become closer friends?",
        "That's cruel... You could have at least hesitated a beat before answering.",
        "You remember that, do you? Well, yes, I do think this is where I belong. For now. I have things that I want to achieve, and I can only do that by staying right where I am. That said, once I've done what I'm here to do... It's hard to say whether I'll stay or leave. I might end up searching for another place to belong.",
        "That's true. I guess trying things out and searching for our own path is what life is about. And both of our paths led us here. This is where we belong right now. Even if it's just a temporary coincidence, we should cherish it while it lasts.",
        "I'm just saying we should make the most of this time we have together, since we don't know how long it'll last. Once it's gone, it might never come back. Right?",
        "Do you remember this place? This is where your dagger almost took my nose off.",
        "You really scared me senseless back then. I thought I was about to die.",
        "Ever since then I've been intrigued by you. Somehow I keep returning to this spot.",
        "Ha! You see right through me, don't you? But it's true that I think about you a lot. What are you going to do once the war is over? Have you decided on your next place to belong?",
        "Will you go back to Dagda?",
        "Almyra? That's a bit out of nowhere.",
        "Oh, I haven't decided anything just yet... But if you're heading to Almyra, maybe I should pay a visit to Dagda.",
        "Because it's where you grew up. That certainly warrants a look. And once we've both seen our fill, how about we plan to meet back up somewhere in Fódlan?",
        "We can tell each other where we're headed next. Who knows? We might find ourselves belonging in the same place again. Though if we do, I hope it'll turn out to be more permanent than this temporary coincidence.",
        "True. The future's more fun when you don't know what it holds. I look forward to finding out, Shamir.",
        "Hey there, Cyril. You're working hard as usual.",
        "Rhea used to assign your daily tasks herself, didn't she? The church employs a lot of people, but not too many of them can claim they got to speak with the archbishop every day. You should be proud of yourself. She must have truly valued your work ethic.",
        "Actually, I was hoping to ask you about Rhea. There's so much we don't know about her, but I thought maybe you...",
        "So cold! Think about who you're talking to.",
        "You... don't know who I am?",
        "That's not what I mean... Well, never mind then. Tell me... Don't you ever miss your homeland?",
        "Yes, Almyra. Eh, judging by that expression, I'm guessing you're not terribly homesick.",
        "I'm sorry to hear that.",
        "Regardless of whose fault it is, I'm still sorry. I'm sorry that I didn't even know that an acquaintance of mine was suffering. And sorry for asking a tactless question about your homeland. I should have known that was likely to bring back bad memories.",
        "I see that. Even still, I apologize for being careless.",
        "If I ever meet the king of Almyra, I'll give him a stern talking-to on your behalf.",
        "You really are on the other side now, aren't you? Huh. Well, if nothing else, it's good of you to turn a blind eye to me.",
        "Huh? Ah, Cyril, it's you. Is there a problem? It's not the first time I've been to the Holy Tomb. Rhea herself took me there once. Beside, the inside's been scoured by the Imperial army. There's nothing left there now.",
        "Fine, I get it! I wouldn't hesitate to make an enemy of Rhea if it came to that...But I'd rather not fight with you. So I'll back off. For now.",
        "Does it matter?",
        "I...guess? But I wouldn't. We're friends.",
        "You really are a stubborn one. All right, then. I'll tell you. I swore I'd change this world so that those without status are no longer oppressed. Though you were never one of the people I was hoping to save. I never knew that there were people in Almyra in your kind of situation. I realized that my own perspective was too narrow. You helped me realize that. So I owe you.",
        "I did. Is it so strange to hear that from me?",
        "Well, I'm not a religious man. I'm sure Rhea wouldn't want to be lumped in with a guy like me.",
        "I see... In that case, maybe I don't need to make an enemy of her. Thanks, Cyril. I think you've brought me a step closer to my dream.",
        "No thanks. Not much need for heightened security at the monastery. Well, most of the time anyway.",
        "You can get as cozy as you like, but I don't think that'll lower the price on your head.",
        "So you're hoping this newfound trust will trick more people into lending you money. Yeah, count me out. You know fighting debt with debt won't work, right?",
        "Yes? That's my current understanding anyway. Why do you ask?",
        "Look at you, figuring things out by yourself. Sorry to say the true story isn't all that interesting. I was born to an offshoot of House Riegan. When my Crest manifested, I was accepted into the ruling bloodline. That's all there is to it.",
        "I think I've finally figured you out. You're working for Lorenz, aren't you?",
        "I see your mind was just as pure when you were a kid as it is now. How'd you even cross paths with her?",
        "Wow. So you've had a particular interest in older women since way back when. Sorry, go on.",
        "Holst? As in Holst the indomitable Alliance general? Huh. I never knew that.",
        "Right. Say, have you considered minding your own business? Isn't that enough of a handful as it is? If you want to have a real discussion sometime, bring me facts. Not a bunch of tired gossip. Deal? Anyway, Teach is waiting for me at the training ground, so I'd better get going.",
        "You'll have to kill time on your own, I'm afraid. My calendar's full at the moment.",
        "I bet your father would just love to hear you say that. And the Albrecht family is from a distinguished noble house, so I'm not sure what you mean.",
        "Ah, the plot thickens. So your mother was a commoner, then?",
        "I know it well. Tales of that place were carried on the wind to where I grew up. Here's my favorite... In a land surrounded by tall mountains, untouched by civilization, lies a hidden village. The people who live there, the mystical Kupala tribe... They say that an ancient and powerful bloodline runs through their veins to this very day. Don't try to find them, people say, or you're liable to get hexed. Or so the tale goes. That part was probably added to spice up the story a bit, but even so, they're certainly a mysterious lot.",
        "And your mother...is she really some kind of Kupala princess or something?",
        "Did your father tell anyone where she was from?",
        "That's not an uncommon circumstance for a noble home. Where is she now?",
        "I'm guessing you two left for much the same reason. Too hard to put up with the foul treatment, right?",
        "I hear you, Balthus. Can't say I don't emphatize, though our circumstances are pretty different.",
        "Your instincts, right. Look, if it makes you happy, you just go on believing whatever you want.",
        "That's...bothersome. And that aside, you do know that time didn't exactly stop for her, right?",
        "Balthus! You and I are of like minds, so I'd like to get your opinion on something.",
        "Noted. But that's not what I wanted to talk about. Ever, really. Do you remember what I said, about the first thing we need to accomplish in this war?",
        "That's right. I'd like to know your thoughts on the matter.",
        "Hm, I had a feeling you'd say something like that. Please, go on.",

Oh! Except to ask you if you've seen Seteth around anywhere.",

        "But if ya see him, then find me, please, and tell me where ya saw him, OK? 'Cause then I'll know where he is. I'll be in the stables if ya need me.

But if I'm not in the stables, and ya need to find me, I'll be at the forest up north 'cause there's a buncha logs lying around up there. I figure I oughta chop 'em up or else someone might trip on a log, or we might run out of firewood. And if I chop it, then it'll save other people time.

        "Oh yeah. Not that it's any of my business. Anyways, Lady Rhea asked me to do some jobs, so I'm doing 'em all. Even some she didn't ask for, but I know need doing, so I'm doing 'em. End of story. And remember, if you see Seteth around, come find me and tell me where you saw him, yeah?",
        "Huh? But I just told ya where I'd be. If I'm not in the stables, I'll be at the forest. If I'm not... Oh, I see. You're right. I'm all over the place, huh? I don't wanna waste your time, Professor, so if ya see Seteth, how about ya tell him I was looking for him and then tell him all the places I'll be.

        "Ya know what? I'm happy to stay! I'll work real hard and be super useful to you! I think it's kinda who I am, living like this, being real useful to other folks. Besides, I'll die if I try to leave, right?",
        "Actually, this ring could come off pretty easy.",

        "Almyra?",
        "Life was a whole lot harder for me there than it's ever been around here. My dad and mom both died in the war, and there was nobody there to look after me. The king, he didn't do anything to help. So I had to survive by being smart. I had to stop being a kid real quick.",

        "Nah, I get sad or mad when I think about it, but I'm used to it, so I don't mind any.",
        "OK, well... Thanks, Claude. If the king of Almyra was like you, maybe things would've been better. Maybe the king's not a bad person and just had other stuff to worry about, but that's not much of an excuse.",
        "Yeah, OK. Anyway, I gotta get back to work. Buncha things to get done.",
        "I don't know what that means, but OK. Bye, Claude.",
        "Sorry, Claude. You can't go past.",
        "Don't matter. Lady Rhea said nobody could go in, so I can't let ya through. I gotta do what Lady Rhea says. You wanna break them rules, then you'll be her enemy. If you're trying to do that, I'll have to fight ya.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Don't know... With your status, you could smack me to the ground and walk right over me.",
        "I thought you were the kind of guy who'd smack down just about anybody if you needed to.",
        "Did you just say you're all about saving people who are oppressed? Really?",
        "It's just... You reminded me of Lady Rhea there for a second. Lady Rhea always tried to save us folks without any status in the world. Like when she let an outsider like me stay at the monastery... That was nice. She brought in those kids from Remire Village when they lost their parents, and...",
        "Lady Rhea didn't do those things 'cause the goddess told her she should. She did it 'cause she wanted to. I can tell ya that.",
        "Thanks to you too, Claude. If I was able to help ya, then that makes me happy.",
        "Aw, just doing my job.",
        "The future? I don't know anything about the future, but I'm kinda busy, so can we talk later?",
        "I work because I work. It's what I do here. And, ya know, I really wanna make myself useful to Lady Rhea, so I can repay the big debt I owe her. Lady Rhea gave me a home when I didn't have one.",
        "Almyra's just where I was born. It's not like I've got family there. If ya love your homeland and wanna go back, then that's nice, but...it's not a thing I wanna do. I like where I am. The best future I can think of...is if things stayed like this forever.",
        "Maybe. Hey, I still got a lot of work. Better get to it.",
        "Petra... What're ya doing?",
        "I thought you were already a good hunter.",
        "Oh, I get it. Huh. Hey, can I ask you a question? I mean, I figure you asked me a personal question before, so now it's my turn. That is, if ya don't mind. Tell me why it is you do all this training and if it's got something to do with where you're from.",
        "War, huh? That's the same as me.",
        "Oh, wow. You do all this so maybe you can be a leader for your people? I guess I was right. You're real different than me.",
        "The same?",
        "Hmm... I don't know. Maybe, but... I guess that does mean I'm putting in a lot of effort every day, just like you.",
        "I think maybe I've gotten better. It feels a lot easier to ready the bow lately.",
        "I do?",
        "You mean, you've been cheering me on all along? That's nice to hear. Well, in that case, I'll support you too!",
        "It makes you happy? It's gonna sound funny, but hearing you say that makes me feel happy too. Ya know, I just realized that there's... Well, when you talk, it's kinda powerful. It's like...everything ya say feels real nice and reassuring. Just listening to you makes me feel better about everything. I think it's a special talent you have.",
        "Maybe the words aren't, but the feelings behind 'em are. I really do think you're special. Now that I know you're supporting me, I'm going to work real hard not to let ya down. And, um... I hope someday I can get strong enough to inspire you the same way you inspire me.",
        "You really think so? Nah, I still got a long way to go. I'm not tough enough to match you yet. So I'm gonna get stronger. Stronger and stronger, so I can support you forever.",
        "I'm tidying up the library— sweeping the floors, dusting the shelves, restacking the books...",
        "Oh, I'm helping out the kid whose job it is. He says I'm making him look bad, but I'm just happy to help. Besides, some of these books are valuable. Gotta handle 'em carefully. Not a lot of people get that,",
        "Easy. There's more stuff to do tomorrow, so the library has gotta get done today.",
        "Yep.",
        "Nah, it's my job and I'm gonna do it.",
        "Like I said, these books need to be handled real careful. Shouldn't you be doing your own thing anyway? This is my job, and I'm gonna do it because I know Lady Rhea expects it done a certain way.",
        "Listen! I said I don't need your help.",
        "Ugh, fine. You do over there. I'll do all of this.",
        "Ugh...",
        "Hey, Ashe.",
        "Well, I just... I wanted to thank ya for helping me.",
        "You know, when ya helped me with cleaning up the library?",
        "Well, I'd rather take care of the stuff I've been asked to do on my own.",
        "Yeah, ya could, but I sure would rather ya didn't. Me doing those jobs is why I get to stay here, even though I'm an Almyran.",
        "Exactly. That's why I don't want anybody's help.",
        "I don't know if that's exactly true, but maybe...",
        "Friends?",
        "I don't know. I guess I've never been anybody's friend before.",
        "Huh... OK. But I've packed up for the day already, so maybe ya could help me out next time?",
        "Ashe is my friend... and friends help each other out. Yeah... that sounds nice.",
        "Ashe! Ashe, I finally found ya.",
        "I'd heard you'd gone missing, so I started looking for you everywhere. Here, I brought you a map. You can use this to get home later, right?",
        "Am I being a nuisance?",
        "But... I thought we were friends? That's what you told me, Ashe. You said friends help each other when they're in trouble.",
        "I know you could. That's why I came out here. Oh no. I just thought about it. I'm gonna be in trouble when I get back, huh?",
        "What? Why? You did nothing wrong.",
        "Friends gotta get punished together too? I don't know about all that.",
        "Wow, so that's what friends are for. OK then. When you're in trouble next time and you need my help, I'll go with ya to get punished.",
        "You betcha. Friends for life, Ashe. That's a promise.",
        "Zzz...",
        "Zzz...",
        "What? Where? Mer-M-Mer...",
        "Oh, sorry. I know it, but it's hard to say.",
        "Nah, it's great. I eat every day!",
        "Every couple days, maybe. It was rough.",
        "Um...",
        "Heh, OK. Thank you, Merm... Mammal... Mar...",
        "Mer...cie. Mercie. Hey! Thanks, Mercie. Welp, I had a good sleep, but there's work to do, now. See ya!",
        "Zzz... Zzz...",
        "Aah! What?! Wh-what's happening?!",
        "I...I was just surprised. Th-thanks, Mercie.",
        "Nah, but it's always real quiet here, so it's where I like to sleep.",
        "No, not really.",
        "Nah, I don't want people treating me like an outsider. I'm better off alone.",
        "Oh. So you don't think anyone thinks that? Should I tell you what happened to me before I came here?",
        "Mercie... I'm sorry. I sure like everyone here too, but... It feels like you're, I don't know... It sounds weird maybe, but I think you're something different than a friend.",
        "No, it's not that. I can't... Ya know how sometimes you can't explain things? This is that. If I had a sister, I think that might be how it feels being around you.",
        "Oh, you got a brother?",
        "I can count on you for anything? Wow...",
        "Ignatz? Why ya following me?",
        "This is my job. I do it myself.",
        "Ya don't have to.",
        "You wanna know what I wanna do?",
        "I'd like to do my assigned work without you pestering me.",
        "Why are you always so concerned about what I'm doing anyway, Ignatz? It's kinda weird, ya know?",
        "There's nothing about Almyra worth talking about.",
        "Nope. Never took much time to look at anything. Why do I gotta talk about stuff I don't wanna talk about just because you're bored, Ignatz?",
        "You don't get it. Look, I'm gonna go. Shoulda done it already.",
        "But there's nothing to talk about. Jeez, what a weirdo.",
        "Hey, Ignatz? Whatcha doing?",
        "I'm gonna get a bucket and get rid of that big puddle everybody keeps walking around.",
        "Huh?",
        "I... Huh? What's so nice about it?",
        "I guess you're right, huh? Weird. I never thought of rain that way. How the world makes look different and how that's kinda special, I mean.",
        "Huh... Maybe you're right. When I remember it, I think Almyra was a real dull and lonely place. Once you're outta the city, there's nothing but the plains and sky, and they stretch on forever. You can lose yourself out there. That's the kind of place it is. It's strange, when I remember it now, even thought it's lonely, it also seems real pretty too.",
        "Heh, you're a big weirdo, Ignatz.",
        "Sitting around, talking about how pretty puddles are?",
        "I don't know. Maybe. But, yeah. I'll think about it.",
        "Hmm, this one oughta do.",
        "I'm picking out logs to carry back and chop into firewood.",
        "Nah, I got it. I don't want ya getting hurt. Logs are heavy sometimes.",
        "Um, Lysithea, ya seem a but shaky. You OK?",
        "I told ya, logs are heavy sometimes. It's hard work if you're not used to it.",
        "Well, if you've learned your lesson, I'm gonna go carry the older logs.",
        "Wood still needs chopping. I got a buncha other stiff needs doing before sundown too.",
        "You know how rough firewood is? You'll get splinters if ya carry it with your soft hands.",
        "You're just not cut out for this kinda work. Look at your hands, they're like a princess's. No point in you learning to chop wood, is there? You don't need to know how to do that stuff. You and me live in different worlds. There's no point lowering yourself down into mine.",
        "Sure, we live in the same places now, but that's not gonna last forever. Don't see how it could, unless I actually turned into your little brother or something.",
        "Nah, I was just asked to go out and buy the stuff on this list.",
        "You actually helped a lot just now, reading that list for me like you did. I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't tell anybody, 'cause I've been trying to keep it a secret, but... I don't know how to read, so I wasn't sure what to do with the list.",
        "I'd hate it if people figured I wasn't up to a job just 'cause I couldn't read.",
        "Thanks, I will.",
        "OK.",
        "That would be pretty helpful, actually.",
        "Lysithea's not a good liar, is she? She knew I was in trouble right away. Hang on. Did she just wanna act like a big sister again? But she looked real happy when she was helping me. And I think I'd like to see that smile again sometime.",
        "Hey, Lysithea. I'm glad I found ya.",
        "Could you read something for me again?",
        "What's the use? I told ya I can't read.",
        "Huh? This one? Was that...apples? So it says...three...apples?",
        "I wonder if there's anything else I can recognize! Let's see...",
        "Lysithea?",
        "Until now, I never thought about how to learn, and since I was hiding it, I never asked anybody. But right now, I feel like I'd be happy to live like this for a little bit longer.",
        "Well, I like having you read things to me.",
        "Yeah, you always seem happy when I ask you to read things, and when you're happy, you smile. I think you're pretty when you smile. I betcha everyone tells you that though, huh?",
        "Hang on a second. Am I the only one who's seen you make that face? Is that why nobody's told you?",
        "OK, well, I'm gonna go take care of this errand for the professor. I'll see you later, Lysithea.",
        "I did it! I did it! OK, so next up is...",
        "Hey, Lysithea! Last night I finished reading the book you lent me. I wanted to tell you right away, but it was late, so I tried to write a letter... Um, Lysithea?",
        "Did I do something wrong? I don't know what you're trying to say.",
        "I'm sorry. I really don't know what you're trying to say.",
        "B...bappy?",
        "Oh! I get ya now. That sounds great, Lysithea.",
        "You're in the way, Hilda. Move.",
        "Are you just here to goof off?",
        "Uh-huh. Where's the fodder then?",
        "I'll take care of it. I'm cleaning the place anyways.",
        "Yeah, well, I don't like it when I feel like I'm not doing my part.",
        "Rough and unreliable, huh?",
        "Yeah? Huh.",
        "Those aren't my people. I was just born there.",
        "Huh...",
        "I can't tell you what I think of folks from Fódlan. I don't really got an impression of them altogether.",
        "There's all sortsa different people everywhere. You can't say everybody of one place is any one thing. It's no different when you're talking about Fódlan or Almyra or anyplace else. And wherever you go, you see people in power keep the weak ones down.",
        "Hilda! You're in the way. Move it.",
        "Maybe you'd know where that is if you did your job sometime.",
        "Come on. The buckets are over near the wall...where they always are...because I put them there.",
        "OK. Just for a minute though. I got more work to do.",
        "Figured you were the one with something to say. Quiet don't bother me.",
        "Your brother write to you a lot?",
        "Write about your life, maybe. Ya know, stuff like, \"I got real lazy again today.\" Or maybe, \"Can you believe I still don't know where they put the water buckets?\"",
        "You're a lazy gal who gets people to do her work for her. I never knew anybody like that in Almyra.",
        "I don't like comparing Lady Rhea with you, but I figure you're right. But you know what's real weird? Nobody seems to mind picking up your slack. Even me...",
        "Nothing worth repeating. Anyway, I gotta get back to work.",
        "Hilda...",
        "Whoa... Tired? Water? Horses? Are you saying you did work all by yourself?",
        "OK, I get it. You did the work 'cause you couldn't find nobody else to do it for ya.",
        "A letter?",
        "You're talking about me behind my back? Honestly, you're so—",
        "Huh, that's pretty nice. Especially since it was from a noble who battles Almyrans.",
        "That letter makes me happy. A lot of people look down on me just 'cause I'm Almyran. So ya know, it's nice to hear somebody accept me as just another person.",
        "That's not acceptance. That's relying on somebody else to do your work. What you oughta do is be a grown-up who your brother doesn't need to worry about so much.",
        "Being proud of what you're supposed to be doing just means you're lazy the rest of the time. Though, I gotta admit...being relied on is kinda nice.",
        "Well, time to get back to work.",
        "Hey, Seteth. I got a delivery for you.",
        "Sure thing.",
        "Concerns? Nah, I'm happy just working for Lady Rhea. I got a way better life now than I ever did before.",
        "Really, there's nothing... Except... Nah, it's OK.",
        "I don't got anywhere else to go, and I just wanna be able to stay here forever. This place Lady Rhea gave me, it's the only place I know to call home.",
        "Well, I got work to do. Excuse me.",
        "Just figuring out what needs doing next. Why, you need something done?",
        "You wanna talk?",
        "Nope. Repaying my debt to Lady Rhea is all I want to do. Lady Rhea might not be around right now, but all the stuff I do? It's still for her.",
        "I can never repay her.",
        "Whatcha mean \"one of the reasons\" you're here?",
        "Motivations?",
        "I don't know if I understand you right. See, when Lady Rhea took me in, it was the first time I ever thought maybe I had a purpose. And I don't know what else I could wish for than that, ya know?",
        "OK, Seteth.",
        "Hey...",
        "Yeah... But it kinda scares me.",
        "If I found something else I was more interested in than repaying Lady Rhea... I don't know. Wouldn't that be kinda like I was betraying Lady Rhea? In a way?",
        "Well, I mean, Lady Rhea is why I got this life...or any life. If I ended up just leaving her... That just seems real ungrateful and kinda rude.",
        "You are?",
        "Well, yeah. Of course.",
        "OK, I get that, yeah. By the way, there's something weird I noticed.",
        "Before, whenever we'd talk, you always used to call Lady Rhea \"the archbishop,\" but just now... Just now, you were calling her \"Rhea.\"",
        "No, I just wondered why.",
        "OK. I'm glad to hear it. Thank you.",
        "You got it.",
        "A-are you OK?",
        "Please, let go of my sleeve.",
        "Yes.",
        "...OK, I surrender. What do you want to say?",
        "How can I help ya? Is it just with listening?",
        "Yeah, this is all real familiar.",
        "You drink too much, blame others for your behavior, and you don't understand you gotta love yourself before someone else can love ya back.",
        "Manuela? What's she doing down there?",
        "Oh...right. Same thing as always. She seems fine. I oughta just keep walking. See no evil, right?",
        "Ah!",
        "Umm... OK, what do you need?",
        "Professor Manuela, why do you do this to yourself? It makes you feel so bad the next day I don't see the point.",
        "Professor, isn't this stuff why you keep running men off? And them running is what upsets ya. Then you do this all over again.",
        "Um... That's OK.",
        "Nope! No thanks! No reason to. You don't have to do anything.",
        "I'll be waiting in the wings for that little heart of yours to shatter.",
        "I was just saying I need to get going. Lotta work to do. Lots. OK. Bye.",
        "Hey, Shamir? How do you think I'm doing with my bow lately? Think I'm getting pretty good? I hit closer to the bull's-eye today, and that felt real good.",
        "\"Fine\"? That might be the nicest thing you've ever said to me, Shamir.",
        "But it's easier if you shoot straight.",
        "Umm... When we get too close to the enemy and we can't shoot the way we're supposed to?",
        "You mean to stay away from the enemies but not too far away or my arrows can't hit 'em.",
        "OK, yeah, I get that. I'm gonna go practice some of those curved shots right now.",
        "You think so?",
        "I will.",
        "Um, Shamir? How do you figure I did today? In the battle, I mean. I tried to not get close to the enemy, and I even used some curved shots just like you taught me, and that was pretty good, huh?",
        "\"Well\"! That's even better than \"Fine\"!",
        "Ha! You said I was \"fine\" before—now you're saying I did well, and that's a big improvement. Especially since everyone knows you're always so strict.",
        "Um, at first you wouldn't even let me hold a bow.",
        "You just gave me a stick with a piece of string tied on it, and you made me practice with that. Honest, I figured you were bullying me.",
        "I was really, really close to giving up, but then you finally gave me the bow. I mean it. I was mad. I'd done all the stuff you told me to, and I knew the way I was supposed to stand, and I could pull the string just so, but...",
        "I just wanted to do whatever I could for Lady Rhea. More than just cleaning and chopping wood and such. I thought maybe I could help with the fighting, but I didn't know anything about swords, and archery was always something that interested me, so... You really helped me out with my dreams, even though you didn't get anything out of it, and that's really nice of you.",
        "And those of us from outside of Fódlan should support one another, right? But it's always been you helping me! I'm gonna keep working real hard with that bow so I can help you back.",
        "Um, yeah. I always wanna get better.",
        "What? Why would I need another teacher?",
        "Have I done something wrong, Shamir?",
        "Why do I need a new teacher then?!",
        "Nah, that can't be true.",
        "A sniper...and a harrier?",
        "Hmm... No. You're my teacher. That's how I want things. I don't know about specializations or whatever, but I know I don't want a different teacher.",
        "I'm fine with you, and I don't want anyone else! I only want you, forever and ever!",
        "Yeah... OK."

        "Thank you. Only do not water the ones in that corner.",
        "They are from [[Duscur]]. They require a dry environment. The roots will rot otherwise.",
        "I owe you a debt of gratitude. In both the extracurricular activities here at the academy, and on the battlefield... Your presence has been instrumental in the defense of [[Dimitri|His Highness]]. You have my sincerest thanks.",
        "Was there something else you wanted?",
        "Then please, excuse me.",
        "Here you are again.",
        "I see. The flowers you helped to water are now in bloom. Have a look.",
        "Indeed. My sister was fond of this one in particular.",
        "Duscur is a dead land. Its flowers were all trampled under the boots of soldiers. But seeing this blossom brings back memories.",
        "I do not know why I am telling you all of this.",
        "But if you are from [[Fódlan]], you must know what became of the people of Duscur. The people who betrayed their allies from [[Holy Kingdom of Faerghus|Faerghus]]. The ones who were punished for regicide. The Duscur are shunned for their crimes, even now. It would be in your interest to not spend any more time around me than necessary.",
        "But...to be completely candid... It pleases me to be able to speak with you like this. If you truly do not mind, I would be glad to receive more visits from you in the future.",
        "Here for the flowers again?",
        "I have two things to say. First, I thank you for supporting His Highness in my absence. But I must also admonish you for taking your own well-being too lightly. On several occasions, I have seen you protect others by putting yourself in harm's way. I am grateful for your efforts, but I feel you should place a higher value on your own life. His Highness relies on you... As do I.",
        "Then show that with your actions. We cannot afford to lose an invaluable asset like you. And...",
        "This greenhouse would be a more lonely place without you in it. It would not be fair to the flowers, to leave me as their only caretaker. Hm. Someday, I hope to show you a whole landscape of these flowers in full bloom.",
        "Yes. Once this conflict is over, and His Highness ascends the throne, I believe it can be done. You must live at least until then. Understood?",
        "I had not thought much of my own life, until now. Except that I would gladly cast it aside for His Highness. That is still true, but now I desire to see the end of this war. Until I can show you the fields of Duscur in bloom... I will go on living.",

        "I've finally found you. It is a fine night. The stars seem closer than usual. Just like last time...",
        "I needed to speak with you.",
        "Yes. When I left the capital, I told His Majesty I would be leaving his service.",
        "He accepted my decision with a smile. I do not think I have finally accepted it myself yet, to be honest.",
        "It was all so that I could give you...this. '''' I have come to ask for your hand in marriage... I adore you. I understand that, as the new archbishop, you cannot take marriage lightly. But even in the face of rejection, I cannot leave these words unspoken. May I have your answer?",
        "You do? You...will marry me?",
        "I am not good with words. Would you really have me, uninteresting as I am?",
        "I see. Why are you making that face? Is it so odd to see me laugh?",
        "I see. Well then... I have one more request. I know it is sudden, but will you prepare to depart on a journey?",
        "I told you once before that I would like to show you the fields of Duscur in bloom. I know that you cannot leave the monastery for long due to your position, but...",
        "'''I am excited also. To show you the flowers as they are meant to be seen, in my homeland... And to be by your side in all the days to come. Yes... It is a fine night, indeed.'''",
        "Your Highness, the hour is late. May I ask where it is you're going?",
        "Very well. I shall accompany you.",
        "You sustained an injury during yesterday's training. My presence may be of use to you.",
        "Are you dissatisfied with me, Your Highness? Please do not hesitate to correct me.",
        "Yes? What is it?",
        "That was because I was unfamiliar with Fódlan speech. Thinking back, such rude manners were inexcusable.",
        "But...",
        "But Your Highness, a vassal is precisely what I am.",
        "I couldn't possibly. I said I would accompany you, did I not?",
        "It must appear strange to them, to see me always in your company.",
        "Of course not. However...",
        "That does perturb me. But not for my own sake. I am concerned about Your Highness's reputation.",
        "I am afraid I cannot agree. But if you were not concerned for your honor in this instance, then why did you intervene?",
        "I do consider Faerghus to be abhorrent. But you are an exception. You offered me your hand, and pulled me out from an abyss of suffering and death.",
        "You risked your life to save a foreigner you had never met. The moment you extended your hand, I decided that only for your sake would I live the remainder of my life. And I would cast it aside in an instant if my death were to your benefit. For that reason, I cannot consider myself your friend. There are still many in the Kingdom who despise the people of Duscur. It would be selfish of me to stand by your side as an equal.",
        "Your Highness?",
        "Of course not. Please forgive my impudence.",
        "Your Highness...",
        "Your Highness, you still have scars on your back. It does you no good to languish in pain. I will procure some medicine.",
        "To hear you say such things...",
        "When I stood before those soldiers and their swords that day, I was prepared to die. But then you suddenly appeared, and you shielded me. I knew then that a savior's hand could reach into even the deepest darkness. I still have not been able to repay that debt.",
        "That was nothing more than my duty as your vassal.",
        "Please...do not look at me that way. You promised me you would build a Kingdom that is proud to boast of Duscur blood. In this Kingdom, where there is no distinction between the people of Duscur and the people of Fódlan... Will I finally, without reservation, be able to call you my friend? Will I...Dimitri?",
        "I will do all I can to bring about that world as well. To be your friend...is what I have always wanted.",
        "But until that time, we must allow no harm to befall you. So please call upon me when you walk alone at night. And even when you go out in the day, please tell me where you are going, and whom you are meeting.",
        "Are you speaking to me?",
        "Do not mock His Highness.",
        "Faerghus destroyed my homeland. Burned it all to the ground. Slaughtered my people.",
        "My father, my mother, my siblings—all were killed. We received no aid. No respite. Faerghus murdered our dignity and torched our pride. His Highness is different. He is the only one who sees my people as human. He risked his life to save mine. And it is thanks to him that I no longer wish for death.",
        "Yes.",
        "I would do it.",
        "Without hesitation. You have misunderstood me. I am the sword and shield of His Highness. Weapons do not have a will of their own.",
        "I warned you not to mock His Highness. I am aware you have a history of friendship with him, but one more word...",
        "What is it.",
        "His Highness does not wish for our military strength to be depleted. The loss of your strength would be significant.",
        "No, I do not.",
        "I heard about your brother. He was at Duscur. He died to protect His Highness.",
        "I will not praise it, then. Instead I will say I would have done the same in his position. Is it really so unnatural to put one's life on the line to protect a brother in arms?",
        "Your insults are merely an attempt to avoid addressing me as what I am. I am a man of Duscur. Yet you were concerned for my life.",
        "Coming from you, that is enough.",
        "How can you kill me, if I am already dead?",
        "At this time of year, the fish are fat. Simply grilling them will bring out their best flavor. Steaming them with herbs is delicious too.",
        "No.",
        "No. My sister and I helped with cooking at home.",
        "Ashe.",
        "Why do you spend time with me?",
        "I am from Duscur.",
        "Being poor and being from Duscur are two different things.",
        "You are a peculiar person.",
        "I am not skilled in conversation.",
        "Reason? I am only here at the monastery because this is where His Highness wishes me to be. Many here are frightened of me. Disgusted by me. I grow weary of it.",
        "Heh. We sound like true monsters.",
        "I suppose.",
        "I am not very good at interesting conversation.",
        "Calm. More forested than Faerghus. Each town had a specialty. Smithing, fishing... You would be better off reading about it in a book.",
        "As we have established, people hate Duscur. Food by itself may be harmless, but it is better not to sow seeds of discontent.",
        "I am... pleased to hear you say so.",
        "You're quite late getting back.",
        "I thought that might be the case. Gilbert was exhausted too. Glad you made it. I saved some food for you.",
        "Yes. How is it?",
        "Your cooking is not bad at all.",
        "Is he the one who taught you?",
        "Yes. I learned by watching my mother. Nothing remains of Duscur. The towns, the people, the culture— all of it was put to the torch. My mother and sister are gone. Yet that simple memory of them standing together in the kitchen is so clear. So real.",
        "Yes. Through me, they are able to live on.",
        "I suppose.",
        "As long as you think of them, they will.",
        "Careful... or you will over-salt it.",
        "Eat as much as you'd like.",
        "Does it?",
        "Uh, yes.",
        "Sylvain.",
        "You are from Faerghus. You must understand how it appears for you to spend time with one from Duscur. To be near me invites tedious misunderstanding.",
        "You do?",
        "It is difficult to believe, considering the discrepancy in skill and number.",
        "I have misjudged you. I was under the impression you only cared about women.",
        "Agreed. But whatever the truth, we are still perceived as traitorous assassins.",
        "Time and effort. Yes, I believe you're right.",
        "Very well.",
        "Yes, you do have some talent.",
        "No, Sylvain. Recently I've heard rumors about you.",
        "Well, you don't lack for self-awareness.",
        "You are being described as indefensibly worthless.",
        "I already knew your reputation concerning women. But these new rumors deprive you of all redemption. I did try to correct them. But I doubt I was believed.",
        "I could not be silent. You saw me as a person, rather than merely as someone from Duscur. I want you to be seen as a person too.",
        "Maybe.",
        "Then we will get along.",
        "Mercedes.",
        "His Highness sent me to collect you.",
        "You were praying.",
        "The Fódlan goddess will accept prayers of any sort.",
        "Yes.",
        "Duscur had a very different view of religion.",
        "In Duscur, there were many gods. The sky had a god. The earth had a god. We made offerings to the war god for victory in battle. Held feasts for the sea god to calm the waves.",
        "Correct.",
        "Why? Duscur is a ruin.",
        "If you insist.",
        "Duscur is gone, but I'm still here...",
        "To oversimplify it somewhat, yes.",
        "There are not many left to pass on the legends of Duscur.",
        "That is a strange thing to say.",
        "Duscur is forever the enemy of Faerghus. No one cares about our culture or history.",
        "You don't care for it?",
        "But it seems I am ever the teacher with you, and seldom the student.",
        "House Martritz of the Empire? I thought they were no more.",
        "Are you certain you wish to impart such precious memories to me?",
        "I see your point. Yes, I would like to learn.",
        "The Fódlan goddess was recognized in Duscur too. The deities of foreigners are seen as the protectors of their respective lands. It has been said that we would offer our prayers to her in times of war.",
        "For peace to come even one day sooner.",
        "I see.",
        "To serve His Highness for the rest of my days.",
        "And you?",
        "To Duscur? There is nothing of interest left there.",
        "Mercedes... If you will allow it, I would like to accompany you. His Highness would surely grant me leave to go.",
        "As do I.",
        "That promises to be interesting. We should pray to the Duscur gods as well.",
        "For victory, we pray to the god of war. Or...",
        "Just the god of war.",
        "Ugh...",
        "Let us leave it at that.",
        "What was that noise?",
        "How did you manage that?",
        "Are you hurt?",
        "Indeed. But do not turn your back next time. Your life could depend on it.",
        "Let me help you.",
        "I will help you clean up.",
        "I have time. Let us fix this quickly. We will need to prepare more food before the others arrive in the dining hall.",
        "You object?",
        "I barely did anything.",
        "I still have much to learn. Truly delicious food brings a smile to people's faces. Until I see His Highness smile in that way, I will spare no effort to improve.",
        "Your skills are not the problem. You merely make errors of negligence.",
        "You simply fail to pay attention to your surroundings. Ensure the pan is on the flame, and that the knives are put away properly. Look at yourself in the mirror before you go out to make certain you have what you need. Everyone makes mistakes. But yours should be easy enough to correct.",
        "Am I that imposing?",
        "I see. I— will try it.",
        "Forgive me.",
        "I did not expect the horse to react so violently when I approached.",
        "Animals have never taken to me. It must be as you said — my face is the problem. I have not honed my smile well enough. I deeply regret the trouble I've caused you.",
        "Yes, I suppose so.",
        "I am truly sorry.",
        "Really?",
        "Of course.",
        "You have changed.",
        "You no longer fear approaching me for help. You simply ask. And now, when the need arises, I will rely on you too.",
        "What is it, Annette?",
        "Kitchen duty is mine today.",
        "Yes. Yours is tomorrow.",
        "These things happen.",
        "Is something funny?",
        "That is harsh.",
        "I have hardly done anything.",
        "Is that so...",
        "It is a meat dish from Faerghus.",
        "Not at all. I was hoping that the food I made would bring a smile to your face.",
        "Good.",
        "Are you injured?",
        "Good.",
        "My apologies.",
        "Save your breath. There were countless people like you in the capital. People who spat, threw things— insults and stones alike— whenever they pleased. Their anger was natural. I do not begrudge them.",
        "You owe me no apology. And I will keep my distance on all other occasions. But on the field of battle, allow me to aid you. If you were to fall, His Highness would grieve.",
        "Understood.",
        "Are you injured?",
        "Apologies.",
        "No matter.",
        "I'm accustomed to it.",
        "Why?",
        "I do not know the truth of it, myself. His Highness says the tragedy was not the fault of my people. But just like anywhere, there were many different people in Duscur. Some very good, and others very bad. It is not unimaginable that some may have conspired to take part in that wickedness. Perhaps we are merely victims. Or perhaps we are regicidal monsters.",
        "Ingrid.",
        "If you think of me as your ally, that will suffice. For me, that is enough.",
        "Ingrid. Is my face frightening?",
        "I made a village child cry.",
        "How did you know?",
        "I see. Duly noted.",
        "Personality?",
        "Wonderful person. This is the first time anyone has ever said a thing like that to me. It is rather... awkward.",
        "Ugh...",
        "Well... let me know if you need anything.",
        "Are you all right? Slow down. Your dinner is not going anywhere.",
        "Well, good.",
        "I did.",
        "Today, yes.",
        "I highly doubt that.",
        "You want me to teach you to cook?",
        "Very well. But only if you are serious and do not quit halfway through.",
        "Chop the vegetables into bite-sized pieces. After that, skim the top layer off the pan. Be mindful of the heat.",
        "There's no need to call me that. Are you displeased?",
        "Good.",
        "Next, we peel the vegetables.",
        "Speak?",
        "Impossible.",
        "All must be done in the proper sequence. And the first step here, whether you like it or not, is to learn how to use the tools perfectly.",
        "For what?",
        "Mistakes happen.",
        "Is that what you want?",
        "As you were, then.",
        "You have not disappointed me. The food itself tasted awful, of course. But there was more to it than that. I could feel the thought you put into it. The wish to please others. To be faithful to what you've learned.",
        "I did. The ingredients were chopped to perfection. You also seem to have learned how to handle fish without my instruction.",
        "You have talent. One day you will surpass me.",
        "I will. However long it takes, I look forward to it. Now, your next lesson will consist of the selection and seasoning of ingredients.",
        "Call me whatever you want.",
        "I suppose I've already committed.",
        "Finished praying?",
        "You barely know me.",
        "As haggard as you look now, you were even worse when I last saw you in the capital.",
        "Still weighed down by the same regret, I see.",
        "If you have the spare time to beg forgiveness, then pick up a lance and train.",
        "Your prayers are mere self-indulgence.",
        "No, I do not. Faerghus needed you. His Highness needed you.",
        "If he commanded me to live, then I would live. Otherwise, I would die with him. I have nothing left to lose other than His Highness. Home, family— All but that man, I have already lost.",
        "You were a knight in service to the king for decades. Not only did you excel in bravery, wisdom, and tactics, but in matters of character you were an ideal knight. Utterly above reproach. That is what His Highness has always said. I have only come this far by modeling my conduct after his stories of you. But now...",
        "My wounds were severe, but I managed. So long as I draw breath, I fight for His Highness.",
        "But in my absence, you have protected him. Thank you, Gilbert, for returning to us.",
        "Would you accept that? I imagine not.",
        "You are still Gustave at heart, even now. I am not fit to replace you. Not yet. I still have a great deal more to learn. For now, all I can do is continue to be a shield for His Highness.",
        "I could not be silent.",
        "Thank you for the advice. However...",
        "It is too soon to treat you like an old man. You still have at least ten years of service in you. Faerghus— no, His Highness— needs you. As do I. Save the old man talk for when you are truly senile.",
        "Even as I work to surpass you, I still rely on you.",
        "Shamir.",
        "I have a message from His Highness. He will meet you in front of the library tomorrow evening.",
        "Hm.",
        "No.",
        "You get to the point. It makes you easy to deal with.",
        "Precisely. Few others seem to think so.",
        "That is all. Farewell.",
        "What are you suggesting?",
        "You mean His Highness's orders.",
        "He should not trouble himself over them. I am honored to attend His Highness, and to represent him in all matters. Ever since he saved my life, serving him has given me reason to live.",
        "Your relationship to the archbishop seems similar.",
        "Then you are not motivated by loyalty.",
        "And if a higher-paying employer comes along?",
        "Then yes. We are completely different.",
        "Thank you for the warning.",
        "Is this your dagger, Shamir?",
        "Unexpectedly sentimental. I did not think you would be the type to let personal feelings affect you in battle.",
        "I was hoping we could chat.",
        "Despite our superficial similarities, we are actually completely different. So I am interested in learning more about you.",
        "You are diligent. As am I.",
        "I could never be like you, either.",
        "That is why we should try to understand each other.",
        "And you could make a good partner for one as devoted to the Kingdom as I.",
        "I would expect no less.",
        "Yes. We should talk again, when we have time."

    "Dimitri": [
        "Perfect timing, Professor. If you don't mind, I have a favor I'd like to ask of you.",
        "It's in regard to sword training. Not for myself, but... Well... To be honest, I've been teaching swordsmanship to the orphans at the monastery for a while now.",
        "I must agree. Frankly, I'm not great with children.",
        "Some of them saw me sparring with the knights one day. They started pestering me to teach them. They were so earnest... I couldn't help but oblige. There's much I wish to show them, but due to my own studies and training, I'm afraid my time is rather limited. Which brings me to my favor. Your swordsmanship is unmatched. I hate to ask this of you, but... Would you consider lending me a hand?",
        "Thank you, truly. I am in your debt. And I always repay my debts, I'll have you know. All of these children lost their families and homes to war or illness. This may sound a bit arrogant, but...I feel it's my responsibility to help them. I lost my parents without warning too. In that way, we're the same. In Duscur, I lost my father, stepmother, and closest friends. I didn't have many allies at the castle after that. In truth, I had only Dedue for companionship.",
        "I'm afraid not. My birth mother fell ill and died shortly after I was born. And my uncle... suffice to say we don't get along. I once had people I could confide in. Family, friends, instructors, even the royal soldiers. But they were all taken away from me four years ago. Ah, but there were those outside the castle walls I was close to. Such as Rodrigue!",
        "Heh, pardon my rudeness. I meant Lord Rodrigue. He is my father's old companion, and the father of Felix. On the occasions he would visit the capital, he'd take me out hunting or on long horse rides. While Dedue is like a brother to me, Rodrigue is more like a second father. It might sound ridiculous, but...he's the kind of man I hope to become one day. Someone who helps others... Someone who can reach out and save a lost soul. Oh... Please accept my apologies for boring you with my life story. In any case, don't forget your promise, Professor. I'm counting on you.",
        "Thank you for your help the other day, Professor. Please, allow me to express my gratitude by taking you to dinner.",
        "I've studied swordsmanship for some time, but your mercenary skills are something else entirely. Speaking of which, there's...another question I must ask you. Were you reconciled with the reality of battle from your first foray? With...the killing part, I mean.",
        "I see.",
        "No... I do not carry that burden well. I doubt that will change, no matter how many years come and go. The first time I led on the battlefield, I was sent to quell a rebellion in the west. It was not a difficult fight. The enemy was not well–trained and their morale was low. A swing of the lance, and your opponent falls. A flash of your blade, and a path opens up. That's the sort of battle it was. Easy...right?",
        "The leader of the rebel army was defeated and the rebellion quelled. This was at the height of the post–war period. I recall coming across a dead soldier's body. He was clutching a locket. Inside was a lock of golden hair. I don't know to whom it belonged. His wife, his daughter...mother, lover... I'll never know. He was a soldier. An enemy. Someone we had cut down without hesitation. But in that moment, I realized he was also a real person, just like the rest of us. Of course, we cannot stand idly by and allow anyone to commit senseless acts of violence. Yet in dispensing what we call justice, we take the lives of cherished family members. Beloved friends. Killing is part of the job, but even so... There are times when I'm chilled to the bone by the depravity of my own actions.",
        "Professor? May I speak freely? When we first met, I thought of you as someone who felt no strong feelings about killing your enemies. I could never trust someone who kills without batting an eye. My heart won't allow it. But after speaking with you and getting to know you better, I can see you're not like that. Now I know, with all my heart, that I can trust you. Thank you for that.",
        "Perhaps it is the gloomy weather, but I am feeling the sting of wounds that should have healed long ago...",
        "The injury I got when that girl stabbed me after the battle at Gronder. Her eyes were filled with revenge...just as mine once were.",
        "I don't know... But I have a guess. ... Ah, I suppose I haven't told you about that yet.",
        "I was attacked inside the monastery the other day. It caused quite the uproar. The ones who attacked me...were some of the youths we taught swordsmanship to, once upon a time.",
        "It seems they were raised by a group of thieves who we put down five years ago. I heard Lady Rhea took custody of them, claiming that the children were innocent. I have taken so many lives...and with each one, I face hatred. During the last five years especially. My life was not so different from that of a wild beast... And that young girl's brother... At some point, I must have... That is why I thought it only natural that someone would retaliate someday. Because I hated, because I stole, and... because I killed. But with those children, it's different... We drew our blades with the best of intentions, only to hurt them in the end. I suppose this is yet another thing we will just have to live with.",
        "Yes... As one who chose to fight, it is my responsibility to confront this anguish and the true nature of war... Until the day my life comes to an end.",
        "You know, Professor... There is something that I only recently realized. I never knew it could be so...comforting to have someone standing by my side...",
        "Perfect timing, Professor. If you don't mind, I have a favor I'd like to ask of you.",

        "Come now, my friend. You must stop staying up so late. Tomorrow is yet another early morning. Then again, I know that matters little. You cannot sleep, can you? Neither can I, of course. I... I want you to know I am sorry for making you do so much when your battle wounds aren't even completely healed yet.",
        "It is a lovely night... Is it not? How many years has it been since I was kept awake by hopes for the future, rather than by nightmares of the past...",
        "I have had the same nightmare for nine long years. A nightmare in which I am constantly tormented by those who have died... They ask me why I have not avenged them... Why I got to live, yet they had to die... No matter how many corpses I piled up for them, in the end, their voices only grew louder. Voices loathing me, calling out to me... Their inescapable death cries ringing in my ears...clinging to my soul... Even now, I can always hear them. I am certain I will be hearing them until the day I die. But I will not cover my ears. I will go on living... and their voices will serve as a warning. As a king...and as a wretch who claimed countless lives...I will build a Kingdom where the people can live in peace. I am sure she would laugh and call such talk foolish... But I wish to change this world in my own way. Well, Your Grace, things will be busy from now on. Our first order of business is tomorrow's coronation. Once a professor and student... Now an archbishop and a king. How very far we have come.",
        "That is true. To me, you will always be the one who guided me so kindly. My ally through all. My beloved... Yes...my beloved.",
        "Listen... There is something I wish to give you before the coronation. Give me your hand.",
        "Please... I beg of you. Say something! If you do not wish to accept it, please just tell me. If so, I will face the truth and walk away.",
        "What is this?",
        "Yes, I see. Right. In that case, let us exchange them, shall we? '''Your hands... Now that I hold them within my own, I see how small and fragile they are. These hands that have saved me countless times... Thank you, my beloved. Your kind, warm hands... May they cling to my own forevermore...'''",
        "It's quiet here, isn't it, Professor? That reminds me. Do you know the legend associated with the Goddess Tower?",
        "They say that wishes made in this tower will come true. I wonder who came up with such a silly notion.",
        "Legends are legends, nothing more. I doubt there are many who really believe that wishes can be granted. The goddess just watches over us from above... That is all. No matter how hard someone begs to be saved, she would never so much as offer her hand. And even if she did, we lack the means to reach out and grasp it. That's how I feel about her. In any case... I suppose there's no harm in passing the time with silly legends. What do you say, Professor? Care to make a wish? We are here on the night of the ball. Why don't you try wishing for something?",
        "A wish of my own... I suppose my wish...is for a world in which no one would ever be unjustly taken from us. Or...something along those lines.",
        "Thank you, Professor. Although, at a time like this... Perhaps it would make more sense for me to wish that we'll be together forever. What do you think?",
        "Haha! Well now, Professor! You must admit I've improved in the art of joke telling.",
        "I'm sorry... I guess that was rather thoughtless of me.",
        "Honestly... I do regret saying such a thing. Please think nothing of it. I've blurted out irresponsible things like that to my classmates. Promises that we'll see each other again and the like. I have no business making such promises for the future. There are certain things that I must accomplish, even if it means risking my life. I may not even have a future to promise to someone.",
        "We should head back soon. It's rude of me to keep you all to myself. Shall we, Professor?",
        "I'm off to the library for a bit of research before I train. After that, a bath and bed.",
        "Ah, no, there's no need for that. I am a grown man, after all.",
        "It was a mere bruise that will heal in no time. No need to fret over me, Dedue.",
        "And there it is again.",
        "Well... You often choose to address me as \"Your Highness.\" When we first met, you used to call me by my name.",
        "To be honest, I much preferred it. I feel more comfortable being addressed by my name, rather than with the honorifics that go along with being a prince.",
        "I did not teach you to read and write so that you'd know how to address me properly. And I brought you to the academy as my friend, not a vassal.",
        "So much has happened since we met, yet we cannot seem to bridge this gap... So be it. I give you leave to return to your quarters. Take an early night and reflect on what I've said. Please.",
        "True, but I would much prefer that we take steps to ease this mindset of yours...",
        "What pleasant conversation you seem to be having. May I join? Please, continue.",
        "I said continue.",
        "Such foolishness runs rampant. I fear it is the reality of Faerghus for now.",
        "Does it bother you, Dedue?",
        "Let me guess. You take exception to the gossip that you used dirty tricks to obtain your position. Is that it?",
        "We're not talking about my feelings, but yours. As far as I'm concerned, those fools can talk nonsense until their tongues fall out.",
        "Because it is my duty to do so. The day my father was killed, I saw the swine who did it. They were not of Duscur. I saw that. Knew it, beyond a doubt. And yet I was unable to prevent the massacre that followed. Nor could I clear away the dishonor of regicide that has unjustly clung to you and your people! I will not rest until I make up for that. I owe you, just as I owe the spirits of those I let die.",
        "Dedue...",
        "Do you really believe I care one bit about the chatter of the ignorant?",
        "I understand the intention of your words. Still, they grieve me. If you wish it so, you may continue to think of yourself as my vassal. I clearly cannot stop you. We need not be anything more, or anything less. If that is what you wish, Dedue, so be it.",
        "No, it is fine. They are still deep...these are from nine years ago. They do not hurt any longer. Besides, it would be a shame if the scars I got from protecting you were to fade. I bear these scars proudly. It makes me think that it was worthwhile that someone like me survived.",
        "Dedue, you say that I saved you, but do you know that you also saved me that day? If I had been unable to save anyone, I would have been the sole survivor. I would have had no reason to keep living. But I saved someone—saved you. That and that alone has always been my crutch.",
        "Have you not heard a word I've said? You have saved me in countless ways. Five years ago, I did nothing but await my execution within my jail cell. Was it not you that saved me?",
        "Listen, Dedue... Perhaps you consider me to be someone special. But I think the same of you. You are irreplaceable. Cherished. So stop saying that we cannot be friends. Stop saying such awful things.",
        "Dedue... Yes, you will call me your friend, again and again. No matter how many hardships I must endure...",
        "Is that so? I...I am glad to hear it.",
        "In the end, I suppose there is no fixing your overprotectiveness, is there... I suppose I can live with that.",
        "Hello, Felix. I see you're here to train as well.",
        "Heh. With that mouth of yours, you grow more like your brother every day.",
        "I cannot fathom why you seem to hate me so.",
        "A beast craving blood, am I? I assume you're speaking of the events two years ago. Last time we met outside the academy?",
        "I deny nothing, Felix.",
        "Perhaps you're right.",
        "And here I thought you had no desire to speak with me.",
        "I suppose not. Is that one new? Wait! Where did you get such a blade?",
        "That pattern around the edge... There's no doubt. It was forged by Zoltan, the master swordsmith!",
        "Huh? Oh, I'm just happy to have laid eyes on it. I don't suppose you'd allow me the chance to hold it?",
        "As though I would be careless with something so valuable.",
        "Come now, that was so long ago! I'm hardly the fool I was then.",
        "What's wrong, Felix?",
        "What is going on with him...",
        "Always so ominous. Well? What is it, Felix?",
        "Do not waste your breath on questions with such obvious answers. They are both the real me. My father, my friends, Glenn... they all meant a great deal to me. And they were all brutally slaughtered. I alone survived. If I do not shoulder the anguish and regret they must have felt, who will?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "You are wrong.",
        "Even still... I cannot forget them, nor can I let them go.",
        "Felix...",
        "Heh. You know, Felix, you really are growing more and more like your brother. Always so sarcastic, and constantly looking for a fight. But deep inside, more than anyone, you–",
        "Oh... It's nothing. But allow me to thank you. Your perspective has opened my eyes.",
        "I see. If you say so, then we will leave it at that.",
        "Hm, this tent is torn. Can you please fix this one first, Ashe?",
        "Sorry, I should probably take care of it myself, but we'd be here until sundown if I—",
        "Oh. Well, thanks. Actually, I'll fetch you something to make the job less of a burden. You like sweet things, right?",
        "Ashe... I've told you, there's no need to act like that.",
        "If Lord Lonato says something to you, I'll write him a letter of protest.",
        "I really don't mind, so you needn't worry about that. And while I'm being candid... I'd prefer it if you didn't speak so formally to me.",
        "I understand. I really do. When I ascend the throne, perhaps I should do a tour of each city...",
        "I'm at a loss... I wish to make things better, but I seem to only upset you more and more. That is certainly not my intention. Perhaps I should leave you be and take care of our shopping...",
        "Ashe. Enough. OK... I've a question. Answer me this. I don't normally eat sweets, so what would you recommend?",
        "Got it. Sugar candies it is. I'll go and fetch some.",
        "Ashe! Of course, I'm glad you asked. After classes conclude for the day, meet me at the training ground. I'll be waiting. And afterward, let's plan on dinner. We'll certainly have worked up an appetite.",
        "Ashe...",
        "Are you still worrying over what I said to you before?",
        "Trust me, I understand the urge to show respect where it is due. However, that is not the case here. Yes, I was brought up in a different family and raised in a different way, but otherwise, you and I are the same.",
        "I suppose I can understand that point of view. But the flaw in your logic is that I am not king just yet.",
        "Hm?",
        "On all accounts, I can say the same of you. But you also have a strong heart. I can't say that about myself. No matter the circumstance, you are never drawn toward darkness. That mindset of yours has done me well on countless occasions.",
        "Precisely. Which means there's never any need to be nervous or uncomfortable around one another. It seems we may have circled back to where we started with this conversation, but... Let's at least agree that we both should learn to bend a bit. How's that sound?",
        "Of course, Ashe. Come at me with everything you've got!",
        "You're out late, Sylvain. Is it safe to assume you've been wildly carousing with women? I'm afraid that behavior simply will not do.",
        "Unfortunately, I can't do that. It's time someone talked some sense into you, and it seems the task has fallen to me. Sylvain... I'm not saying you can't enjoy yourself at night. But you must learn the art of moderation. Again and again, you end up wandering the streets until the early morning...",
        "The way your mind works absolutely confounds me. How did you even arrive at such a notion?",
        "Naive and uptight? Yes, well, compared to you, I imagine I'm downright run–of–the–mill.",
        "Will you never let that rest?! It was many years ago! Perhaps a good knock on the head will help you finally forget about it...",
        "If I do as you wish, will you truly promise to improve your behavior?",
        "I am a man of my word. I will...attempt to do as you ask. But you had better uphold your end of the bargain as well.",
        "Sorry! I need to...hide. In here. Just for a while. I'll have you know this is all your fault!",
        "It's, um. A girl. From the academy.",
        "This is all because of your insistence that I go and ask a girl out!",
        "Look, you kept true to your promise to improve your behavior. So I felt it was only right to make good on my side of the bargain too...",
        "I clearly underestimated the difficulty of the task. But...what do I do now?",
        "It was my naiveté that brought this about. I cannot place this immense burden on your shoulders...",
        "There wasn't time for consultation! I only learned she was leaving on the day of her departure.",
        "Sylvain... Very well. When that time comes, I promise to help you as best I can. A knight of Faerghus never goes back on his word... Isn't that right? You're a good man, Sylvain. I'm sorry to do this to you. Best of luck!",
        "I certainly won't, but thanks for your concern, Mercedes. It's more of a hobby than anything, so don't worry too much.",
        "Hmm... Didn't you say you hoped to take the sword test soon?",
        "To be honest, I've been a bit worried, as I haven't seen you at the training ground much.",
        "It didn't occur to me that you could have forgotten... But you're right, I should have mentioned it. As an apology, why don't you let me help you with your swordsmanship?",
        "OK, but keep in mind that since we're short on time...we may have to \"overdo it\" a little.",
        "It's settled. Let's begin! Don't tell me you've forgotten how to hold a sword! We have our work cut out for us...",
        "Ugh... Well. I didn't realize offering to help you would mean risking my life.",
        "Yes... I know you didn't intend to murder me. Though that scare likely took years off my life...",
        "Nonsense. It's far too early to give up. The first time I picked up a sword, I was much like you. It's true that different people are better suited to different things, but if you keep at it and refuse to give up, you're certain to improve.",
        "Hm, it seems I didn't dodge your sword fast enough. Don't worry, I can easily repair it.",
        "No, please don't worry yourself over it. Just focus on your exam.",
        "Mercedes. I'm sorry to ask this of you, but...will you lend me a hand?",
        "It's pathetic, I know, but I fear my sewing skills are... Well, as you can see, they're just about nonexistent.",
        "Ah, well... That is to say... Would you please teach me to sew? I hear you're rather amazing at it.",
        "You will? Thank you! I owe you for this.",
        "No need to dance around the issue. You're fed up with my clumsy efforts, aren't you?",
        "I–I'm just... I'm so sorry. Really. I try to be careful, but with delicate work like this, I just can't seem to manage.",
        "My inability to control my own strength is humiliating. Of course I'm useless at needlework.",
        "Right you are. To give into despair isn't like me. Thank you for the reminder. OK... I'm ready to give it another go.",
        "No! I bent another one!",
        "You've been spending a lot of time at the training ground, Mercedes. As far as swordsmanship goes, you're like a whole new person.",
        "It's all because of your own hard work. Compared to you, I...",
        "Well, I can hold a needle and thread without breaking anything now. That's...something.",
        "True... I'm sorry for being such a burden.",
        "My birth mother? From my father's accounts, she wasn't great at it either.",
        "Yes. I don't really remember what she was like. But I remember my stepmother...always sitting by the window, sewing away.",
        "She always looked so lonely when she was sewing. So unreachable... She was kind to me, yes. But when she was like that, it was hard to talk to her. I'm not certain she would have wished to teach me.",
        "Don't worry about it. If I don't talk about those things sometimes, I'll risk forgetting them altogether. And that would truly be a shame.",
        "Ah, but now I'm just going on and on about myself. Why don't you tell me more about you?",
        "It's hard to think of something on the spot, isn't it? You could speak of your family, I suppose.",
        "Of course. I will listen for as long as you wish.",
        "Something like that. And you?",
        "It really is...",
        "You are a kind soul, Mercedes.",
        "Kind? Me? No, not at all. I am just...a killer. A disgusting monster.",
        "Mercedes... I... I am scared...so scared that I will forget their faces. The people who have died...who I have killed. I cannot let myself forget them. I know that, and yet... Whatever my feelings, it is all the act of a monster.",
        "If someone had said those words to me five years ago, I would be a different man today.",
        "My own dreams... I have never given it any thought. What about you? What do you want, Mercedes?",
        "But... I have no right to stand beside you.",
        "Mercedes... I want the same thing. If you allow it... I wish to stay by your side.",
        "Oh, it's not too terribly early. And what about you?",
        "A morning walk? Funny. Gustave always kept the same habit. You really do remind me of your father, Annette.",
        "Annette... Something's been weighing on me. Something I've done terribly wrong. Your father... He worked tirelessly. I don't know if I ever saw him take a rest. I feel as though, in a way, we stole him from you.",
        "Oh? Any reason in particular?",
        "Your...big brother?",
        "No, nonsense! I promise you, I don't mind at all. It's certain that my days would have been filled with more fun if I'd had a little sister like you. What kind of things did Gustave tell you about me? I'd love to hear more on this topic.",
        "You know what? Never mind. I have a bad feeling about where this is going. How about you forget we had this talk altogether? And don't mention it to anyone...",
        "Of course. How may I be of assistance?",
        "Ah, so you wish to hear about the Gustave that I knew... As you know, he was knight who served the royal family since my grandfather's reign. To me, he was a teacher of martial arts and tactics. He was someone I depended on since I was a small child. But he was also a very stern and strict instructor.",
        "Is that so? Funny, I suppose in front of his family he felt the need to demonstrate proper etiquette.",
        "Even all these years later, there's something I recall with perfect clarity. It happened in the autumn of my eleventh year... Before the break of dawn, he woke me suddenly. Said he'd heard a disturbance and had me grab my bow... Then he set me and a fellow pupil loose on a dark mountain. Our only directive was to \"go catch a deer.\" As you well know, autumn in the capital is very cold. Now imagine being up on the mountain at night, with no idea what might jump out from the shadows. That, in a nutshell, is the Gustave I knew.",
        "I recall one other defining detail... He used to speak of you at every possible opportunity.",
        "Are you sure you want to know? There's one story he used to tell, from when you were very small...",
        "Ah, perhaps...",
        "Yes, that seems the only thing to do. It's a promise.",
        "Is this about Gustave again? I have plenty more stories about him, but perhaps it is time for you to speak with him yourself...",
        "About me?",
        "Ah, well... I am afraid there is not much of interest for me to tell you.",
        "I see... Well, it's a little hard to say what my favorite is. I just don't really have any strong feelings about food. That said... You're pretty keen on sweet things, right, Annette?",
        "Yes... It often had long lines outside, didn't it? The castle guards often spoke of it.",
        "Say, Annette... When this war is over, where will you go? I heard that you were close to Baron Dominic back in the academy days.",
        "Ah, that settles it, then! We'll have to get your father working twice as hard!",
        "Oh, of course. I will keep that in mind.",
        "This is sudden... Why so formal! You are not about to tell me you intend to leave the army, are you?",
        "Come now, no need to exaggerate. Do not forget that I abandoned them and fled once as well.",
        "Annette... You probably do no realize, but over those five years, I took many, many lives. I slaughtered generals and officials alike, with brutality you would scarcely think a human was capable of. And as I have intensified my fight with the Empire, how many people have fallen in the capital? My hands are already dripping with blood. I cannot be forgiven.",
        "What are you saying?",
        "Starve me... Hahaha!",
        "Heh... Sorry... I could not help myself. Certainly, with you around, I will not have any cause to frown. By all means, join me, Annette. And never lose that sweet smile of yours.",
        "Oh, there's no need for such humility. Thanks to all of your hard work, you're improving rapidly.",
        "You know, Ingrid... I may be the victor when we cross spears on foot like this... But on horseback, your handling of a lance is far superior. Can't I be allowed to have my own area of expertise?",
        "Such high stakes. By the way, where did you learn that fierce jab of yours? I'm pretty sure the only other person I've seen perform that move is Glenn...",
        "I thought as much. I never imagined I would be on the receiving end of one of his techniques again. Glenn and I once studied under the same instructor. I've sparred with him more times than I can count.",
        "Well now! He never said any of that to me.",
        "That is true. We spent about as much time arguing as we did training. I can't believe it's been nine years since the Tragedy of Duscur... Since we lost Glenn, along with so many others.",
        "It would be my pleasure. After all, I value our training sessions as much as you do.",
        "Ingrid... I've been doing some thinking, and it occurs to me that I owe you an apology.",
        "In a just world, you would be happily married to Glenn. He...he truly loved you. And it's clear that you cared deeply for him as well. But on that awful night, he died right before my eyes. I could do nothing to prevent it. In a way, I'm responsible for you losing the joyous future that should have been yours. I know my words can change nothing but... I'm so sorry, Ingrid.",
        "Proud? Truly?",
        "Are you really trying to turn his needless death into an ideal to uphold? Gah, you and he are so alike.",
        "You weren't there. You didn't witness his last moments. If you had, you wouldn't feel that way.",
        "You would do well to rethink that ideal, my friend.",
        "What is the matter with me?",
        "No... I should be the one to apologize. I did not intend to say such things. I lashed out like a child. You were right to rebuke me. I am disgusted by my own inability to express myself. Will you allow me to explain?",
        "At the Tragedy of Duscur, I saw countless corpses. Of course, I saw his too...Glenn's. Ingrid, I doubt you would have been able to see him. They were unable to bring his body back, after all. He must have died an agonizing death, full of pain and regret. That is what I saw in his face.",
        "In that wasteland, there were no beautiful, proud deaths that could have been written about in heroic tales. Not one. I do not want you to die a death like that. Not even for the sake of loyalty or duty.",
        "You leave me little room for argument. Have I disappointed you?",
        "What has changed, Ingrid? You were so obstinate the other day...",
        "Hm...",
        "Aha! Finally, you score a point against me on the ground. You have improved, Ingrid.",
        "It does not matter what sort of technique it was. You won. If this had been a real battle, I would be dead. You wielded your lance well, without any hesitation. Has your approach changed?",
        "I remember. What did you mean by it?",
        "I see...",
        "And...how exactly am I meant to interpret that?",
        "Oh? Well then... Ingrid, when this is all over, I want you to— Um...to support and defend me. As my knight. I have been thinking of telling you this for a long time. We get along well, you and I.",
        "Yes. And while we're at it... Do not die on me, Ingrid. Promise me that.",
        "Hm? What are you talking about, Raphael?",
        "Ah. I suppose I do recall something like that. I happened across a toppled wagon, you see. Those people needed my aid, so I aided them. But what of it?",
        "You want...my training secrets, so you can build more muscle? I'm sorry, but...I honestly don't think I can offer anything that would help you. The royal family has always been blessed with immense strength. I imagine it's largely due to our blood, and perhaps our Crests.",
        "As I said, I really wish I could help, but... Look, logistics aside, why are you so interested in my strength to begin with?",
        "I see. In that case, I suppose I could try to help you. Though I meant it when I said I'm not sure I have much to offer.",
        "I'm no expert on the topic of building muscle... However, for greater strength, you could try devoting more time to spear and sword training. You probably already know that, eh? Of course you do. Let's see... As a child, I was forced to train by running through the mountains all night in heavy armor!",
        "Aside from that... I trained by lifting large boulders, or carrying multiple barrels filled with rocks.",
        "Wait a moment! You don't want to push yourself too hard too quickly. You'll damage yourself if you're not careful.",
        "Perhaps... I should not have told him all that.",
        "Raphael! What's the matter? You look awfully pale.",
        "What in the world happened?",
        "Well, what are you waiting for? Get yourself to the infirmary! If you can't walk, I'll carry you there. This could be very serious!",
        "Steady yourself, Raphael. Protecting your sister is a task that will fall to you alone. Is that not why you wish to become a knight?",
        "Wait... You were training all night? Raphael... Tell me exactly what sort of training you did last night.",
        "Right. I believe I get the picture. And is this something you've been doing every night recently?",
        "I see. Raphael, listen to me very carefully. Your ailment...is ordinary muscle pain.",
        "After a training session like that, even my muscles would probably be aching. Didn't I tell you not to push yourself too hard?",
        "Well, you caused them to hurt, sure, but that doesn't mean...",
        "Hold on! What happened to your muscle pain? And if you eat too much, you'll give yourself a stomachache! Uh oh... He's headed straight for the stairs. I thought he could hardly walk with his muscles in that state...",
        "Let this be a lesson to you, Raphael... There are times when even your muscles can betray you.",
        "Marianne?",
        "Oh... I'm sorry for disturbing your prayer.",
        "I see. What were you praying for?",
        "Forgiveness? For what?",
        "What matters is that they came back safely in the end. You shouldn't blame yourself for that.",
        "That? It was just a scratch. A small price to pay for your safety.",
        "I would never regret helping an ally, even if it meant losing my own life.",
        "How so?",
        "Is that so?",
        "Forgive me, but I will be there for you. Whether you want me to or not.",
        "Marianne?",
        "May I sit here? There isn't another open spot...",
        "I'm sorry... I should have eaten in my quarters. I know you asked me to stay away from you.",
        "I apologize for whatever foolish thing I said to upset you, truly. But...may I ask what happened?",
        "Misfortune?",
        "Ah, so I didn't offend you. You're trying to tell me I should be more concerned for my own safety. Well, I suppose I could improve in that regard. As for you causing misfortune, I think that's far from the truth. In fact, I find you to be a lucky charm of sorts.",
        "But misfortune finds us all. Perhaps those around you have suffered or even perished, but look at you. You're still here, alive and well.",
        "It doesn't feel good, does it...to be the one left behind? You feel guilt for not dying along with the others.",
        "You and I are the same. Maybe you should fear being cursed with misfortune for coming near me.",
        "Ah, a smile and a laugh. Coming from you, that's a rarity. This must be my lucky day.",
        "Is it so terrible a thought?",
        "So it would seem. I told you that you are extraordinarily lucky.",
        "I often think the same of myself... Especially after battles where many lives were lost. But I must go on living. I cannot give in to death so readily. It is my duty to atone for my sins, and to pay for the lives I've taken. I suppose...that must be why the goddess allows me to live on.",
        "Only you can know that. But I believe there is a reason.",
        "Marianne... Life is difficult.",
        "If that is so, then carry on as you are. There is no need for you to force yourself to smile as your soul bleeds. But please... Whatever you do, do not give up on yourself, or your precious life.",
        "If you were to die, I would be devastated.",
        "Is that so?",
        "So it is. I often feel I am not strong enough to live it.",
        "Do you?",
        "As long as you are carrying on, I have yet another reason to carry on myself. I promise to the goddess of Fódlan that I will never give you cause to despair.",
        "Oh? Are you on cooking duty today, Flayn? That's unusual.",
        "Well, you're in luck. I've just finished training and am positively ravenous. If you don't mind, I'd love to sample your cooking.",
        "I'm sure it will be great. Thank you, Flayn.",
        "There were a few suspiciously crunchy bits here and there, but other than that, it was fine.",
        "Say, Flayn... May I have a second helping?",
        "Of course. I wouldn't want it to go to waste after all the effort you put in. This kind of mishap can happen to anyone, you know. Don't let it get you down. Besides, I can tell you put a lot of love and dedication into preparing this food for everyone. That alone makes it taste good.",
        "I speak nothing short of the truth, always. It was delicious, and I look forward to eating it again sometime. I'll agree, there is no need to make enough for everyone though. If you like, you could just cook enough for me.",
        "Ah. Hello, Flayn. I could ask you the same thing.",
        "I see. I'm here for the same reason.",
        "It's nothing. I just have a bit of a headache.",
        "That's kind of you, but I'm fine.",
        "This headache...is something I've dealt with for a while now. Ever since my family and friends were murdered before my eyes. I must never forget that day. I must never allow their deaths to be forgotten. I feel this headache is a reminder of sorts, of those I failed to protect...and of their murderers, who still roam free.",
        "Perhaps. Unfortunately, they have left this world, so I can no longer ask their preference.",
        "Good night, Flayn. And...thank you.",
        "And what about you? Have you got something on your mind again? You should really go to bed. It is chilly out, and you could catch cold.",
        "What's the matter? Have you been having nightmares?",
        "Of course.",
        "Your words that night touched me deeply. It felt as though I had been punched in the gut. But more importantly, I think I owe you an apology. I...lied to you.",
        "Do you recall when I ate that meal you cooked and I told you it was delicious? The truth is that no matter what I eat, I can scarcely taste it. I have not had my sense of taste for... nine years now.",
        "I am sorry. When I said the food was good, I was just saying what I thought you would want to hear...",
        "In the end, I am not sure it was kind.",
        "Flayn...",
        "I like your cooking. I cannot taste it properly, but in my book, it is truly delicious.",
        "Flayn? What is the matter? Is something weighing on your mind again? It is freezing out here! You should be bundled up in your warm bed.",
        "Afraid of it? Why?",
        "I cannot quite grasp what you are describing... But I can promise you one thing. No matter how many years go by, I will always remember you.",
        "Listen carefully, Flayn. There is something I have been wanting to tell you.",
        "You know that dish you made the other day? It was so sweet it made my tongue go numb.",
        "Well... I could only really taste the first bite, so I may have been imagining it. But still! I was so happy. That moment will always put a smile on my face whenever I remember it. I could never forget you, Flayn. I promise.",
        "Besides, we have fought side by side. We are friends. I am sure all of the others would say the same.",
        "Is something the matter?",
        "Cues?",
        "Hey... Wait! I did not mean for you to fall asleep right here!",
        "Flayn! Ah... She is hopeless...",
        "Here you are, Gilbert. Have you finished your prayers?",
        "Ah, but you and I are the only ones present, so I suppose I should not call you Gilbert. Gustave... It's been a while, hasn't it? Around three years, I believe?",
        "Gustave... It has been eight years since I last called you by that name.",
        "There is no need to explain, old friend. I can guess at your reasons... The Tragedy of Duscur. You felt responsible for that incident, and sought respite in the goddess, abandoning your name, rank, and homeland in repentance. Am I right?",
        "I always knew you for a pious man. And I figured that if you were to leave, this is where you would end up. You have changed much. Your face does not have the same resolve it once did.",
        "I can't disagree.",
        "My father and mother are gone. No amount of regret will bring them back.",
        "You saved my life at Duscur. I have only gratitude for you, no blame to speak of. Return to the Kingdom, Gustave. I need your strength to help rebuild the rotten husk that Faerghus has become.",
        "I see. Though much has changed, your stubbornness remains. I have no desire to trouble you. If you do not wish to return, that is your choice to make. But I do advise you to at least visit the place of your birth. If only for your family's sake.",
        "I've not had to weather your lectures in many a year. And here I thought you were avoiding me.",
        "Your words ring true, of course. I admit I was a bit careless out there. However, I have always been a man who is good for nothing but war. To best support our cause, I must carve a path through the battlefield with my own hands. I truly believe that will lead us to victory. Why the dark expression, Gustave? Do my words trouble you so?",
        "I do not wish to speak of that matter. As I said before, I feel no resentment toward you.",
        "You want to hear my true feelings, Gustave? Then let me ask you this. Why did you save my life that day? Why did you not allow me to die along with the others? If you truly wish to atone for your sins... Then take my life, here and now.",
        "I see. So, you will continue to protect and serve me, will you? In that case, when I assume the throne, I will order you to work for me in the Kingdom.",
        "My father would be happy to see such a day. Perhaps I will ask you to instruct me further in the ways of battle when that time comes.",
        "What brings you here at this hour? And with sword in hand, no less. Hardly the appropriate attire for prayer.",
        "I see...",
        "How astute of you. So, you think you can see right through me, do you?",
        "I am sorry to burden you with this, but you have my gratitude. Now, make it quick.",
        "You really are...a cruel man...",
        "Even if those who have died...the many whose lives I have taken...would rather see me dead?",
        "Look at my hands...",
        "When I saw your sword swing before my eyes... For the first time, I did not wish to die. Many times I have felt that I cannot afford to die... But this was the first time I truly feared the prospect. Tell me, Gustave... Is it really right for me to live?",
        "I... Thank you.",
        "I had intended to train, but this rain is unrelenting...",
        "Uh, yes... Quite.",
        "Hm. At any rate, did you need me for something?",
        "Of course, I'd be happy to help. I was just hoping for a useful way to pass the time until the rain lets up.",
        "Ahem. I just— Hahaha!",
        "Hahahaha! Oh my. I'm sorry, Alois!",
        "Oh goodness, not at all.",
        "But when a joke is unfunny to a certain degree, it somehow comes full circle into hilarity.",
        "It's true. Laughter is not one of my strong suits. I actually can't recall the last time I laughed like that. Alois... Perhaps you should focus your efforts on honing this comedic talent of yours.",
        "Heh, my apologies. I should refrain from commenting on the...quality of your jokes. What's important is that they bring joy, right?",
        "Alois! What about organizing the weapons? Oh. He's gone, isn't he...",
        "I must apologize, Alois. If only I had paid closer attention...",
        "Indeed. With morale this low, we may yet have trouble making it back to the monastery.",
        "Alois? What exactly are you...",
        "Hahahaha!",
        "Oh, Alois... How do you come up with those jokes? That last one was positively hilarious!",
        "Hahaha! Haha!",
        "My help? I'm not sure what you mean.",
        "Ah, you mean the day you came up with those terribly hilarious jokes.",
        "Well, you certainly succeeded. Our journey home was much easier as a result. As for myself, I am not much of an orator. I could never have done the same in that situation.",
        "Well, I admit the jokes themselves were...perhaps not your best work. But there is no harm in that. Even when you stumble, your good humor brightens everyone's mood and wins their trust.",
        "As one who is bound to lead, I could stand to learn a lot from you. I am often told by both friends and subordinates that I am...without humor. Alois, if you would be so kind, could you teach me to tell jokes?",
        "No... I would like to learn from you, Alois.",
        "I will endeavor to be a good student.",
        "It's my daily routine. I'm ill at ease until I've held a weapon in my grasp.",
        "Hm. Right you are.",
        "I'm not sure it was quite that long ago. Not really. But it matters not. I remember those times well. Particularly your first words to me. \"Look at that young maiden wielding a giant lance. How adorable!\"",
        "It's all water under the bridge. Now, back then I was quite furious about it.",
        "Speaking of... Do you ever think about going back to House Charon? Do you...Cassandra?",
        "It doesn't bother you? Being labeled a criminal?",
        "Is that so?",
        "I can't say the thought has never crossed my mind. However, I am the son of a king. It's not possible for me to put my own desires before the good of the Kingdom.",
        "Don't worry. I've been working on that. Stretching is a part of my daily routine.",
        "And who told you that?",
        "That was ages ago... I've had plenty of time to improve since then. Now I count swordplay as one of my specialties. Care to see for yourself?",
        "I could say the same of you. I suppose we students still have much to learn.",
        "Greedy? I see. I'll take that note to heart. You have my thanks for the instruction.",
        "I appreciate the invitation, but I have certain duties I must attend to this evening.",
        "I thought you'd say that. You have the same sense of responsibility as I do.",
        "I would like that as well. Ever since I saw you wielding a sword all those years ago, I've been following in your footsteps. To be able to stand with you and cross swords is quite a—",
        "Right! Prepare yourself!",
        "Oh! My apologies, Catherine. I was just wondering whether you had any desire to return to Faerghus.",
        "May I ask why you have devoted yourself to Lady Rhea?",
        "Wow... I'm not sure I can compete with that.",
        "That is a shame. I am certain Faerghus could use your help in the near future. House Charon is one of the most sterling noble families after Fraldarius and Gautier. It would be reassuring to know that you had taken up your position as head of that house...",
        "Is something wrong?",
        "Well, I...",
        "Sorry...",
        "Do not worry. I will be myself again in a moment.",
        "This war...once it is over, I will have to go back to the capital, and you will remain here as a knight of Seiros.",
        "When that happens, there will not be many chances for us to have these little duels of ours, will there?",
        "It will be hard to get by without them. I've grown very fond of these sessions.",
        "Please... Return to the capital with me.",
        "You were the one who told me to speak frankly...",
        "I just...want to be near you.",
        "I was just saying what I felt.",
        "Do you really still see me as that young prince?",
        "Yes... I do.",
        "Hapi, you must know that it's rather uncomfortable to be the subject of such an unflinching gaze.",
        "Apologies, but I'm not sure what you're referring to. Care to elaborate?",
        "I do not recall meeting you previously either. Although... Long ago, I sometimes accompanied my father as he traveled the Kingdom. Perhaps we crossed paths...",
        "Kidnapped? What do you mean by that?",
        "... This may be unwelcome from a stranger like myself, but I want you to know that it's perfectly acceptable to be angry about such unfortunate circumstances. I can't fathom why someone would cause you pain like that. I'm sorry you had to endure such a thing. You have every right to feel aything you need to feel toward the person responsible for your suffering.",
        "What's the matter? Was it something I said?",
        "Yes, of course. If our meeting again can help you in any way, you need only ask and I'll be there.",
        "I did not expect to see you here, Hapi. I get the feeling that you didn't come for training.",
        "Remembered? Ah, does this have something to do with why you were staring at me earlier?",
        "Anselma... Yes, of course. But how do you know that name? That is what my stepmother was called in the Empire. In the Kingdom, she was called Patricia.",
        "Just one moment. You may understand, but I most certainly do not. How did you know my stepmother?",
        "Friends? Are you sure?",
        "Are we really that much alike?",
        "I share no blood with my stepmother, but to hear you say that... It pleases me greatly. She was the one who raised me. I suppose it makes sense that we would share certain mannerisms. To think that the person you mentioned was my stepmother is...baffling, to say the least.",
        "For all intents and purposes, my stepmother was completely cut off from the outside world. Suffice it to say few knew that my father had taken a second wife.",
        "I would very much appreciate your silence on the matter. But thank you, truly, for all that you said. Truth be told, the union between my father and stepmother has given rise to...much speculation. But for now, what's truly baffling to me is the identity of that lady you mentioned... She welcomed my stepmother into the Kingdom after she fled home due to political strife... Hm. No, I must stop this. It's time to put an end to this discussion. Baseless speculation will get me nowhere.",
        "Well, if that happens, come back here and I'll keep you company. I'll be training a while yet. I wonder... Could Hapi's captor truly be her?",
        "Hapi, I must speak with you. I've realized the woman who held you captive...was Cornelia herself.",
        "Whether Cornelia's words prove true or false, any lead is worth following.",
        "Her daughter... Neither my father nor I knew that the Imperial princess was in Fhirdiad at the time.",
        "She believed that Father hid it from her? What could he have gained from such a thing?",
        "As she was seeking asylum from the Empire in the Kingdom, Lord Arundel was obligated to hide the Imperial princess's whereabouts. If her location had gone public, the Empire would have demanded her return. She would undoubtedly have become a political pawn in the Kingdom as well. The decision to hide her was not my father's. I did not realize until much later that the girl I'd met under such strange circumstances was my stepsister.",
        "I can only speculate, but it seems there was a misunderstanding between her and my father. Although she was the queen consort, in truth, my father and stepmother were not even allowed the dignity of being alone together. And the one who persistently inserted herself between them was their intermediary...your captor. It was Cornelia herself.",
        "I believe so. Meanwhile, she may have hidden my stepmother's presence from Lord Arundel as well. If Cornelia caused my stepmother to miss out on seeing them, exhorted her, used her, and then also caused the Tragedy... Hmm.",
        "I fully agree. Countless people have been subjected to undue suffering as a result of her behavior. That is why I would like your help with something, if that's agreeable to you. You are my only hope.",
        "I wish to learn all that you know about Cornelia. If I follow the traces she left behind, perhaps I can finally learn the truth of the tragedy. And perhaps I'll also be able to find a way to lift the curse she placed upon you...",
        "That is perhaps for the best. That said, I am a stubborn man who is not often inclined to give up. I will not allow history to repeat itself. Neither the tragedy, nor your own personal torments.",
        "You have my word. Should a thousand beasts raise their claws at me, I will happily send them running."

        "This may seem a bit sudden, but...I want to thank you, Professor. That is, for letting me live my life the way I want. I've noticed you've been giving me fewer of those soul-revealing gazes lately. I appreciate you making an effort to not trouble yourself over who I spend my time with.",
        "Well, of course. Did you think I wouldn't notice? It's kind of sweet, in its own way.",
        "If you say so...But I notice you doing it all the same. It's kind of sweet, in its own way.",
        "Professor, may I tell you a story about when I was younger? I was an orphan, living in the back alleys of Enbarr, until one day I was overheard singing... That was when my new life began. I was suddenly a songstress in the Mittlefrank Opera Company. Performers, nobility...I met so may people. But none of them ever really knew me. I was just some young pretty girl who could sing, a spectacle to be admired. Even though everyone praised my looks and my voice, and they showered me with gifts... I knew, one day, I'd be old. My looks would fade, my voice would change, I wouldn't sound the same. And I started to wonder, when I did get old, what would I have left? I'd be old, alone...and back on the streets of the capital, right where I'd started.",
        "You can never be certain about what the future will bring.",
        "That's sweet of you, even if you are just flirting.",
        "I never had much to begin with in life, and I worry that one day, I'll be that way again... That's why I keep searching for someone who will love me. Someone unaware of the songstress, who can love a girl that used to be scared and alone on the streets of the capital... I wonder if such a strange person can even exist.",
        "Oh, is this where you've been? Everyone's looking for you. With the war over, I'd like to think they's at least give you a few days' rest. Don't worry, I won't tell them you're here. It's a rare occasion for me to have you all to myself.",
        "'''A life singing for you in a peaceful world...I imagine that life will be more wonderful than i ever could have hoped. I love you. I could never sing anything as pure as those three little words.'''",

        "No, I've giving up on that. Besides, maybe the person I've been looking for is closer than I realized.",
        "What? Is that—That's a ring. It would be very embarrassing if I had the wrong idea, so I have to ask... Are you proposing? Here? Now? T-to me?",
        "I don't know what to say. Are you sure? You want to spend your life with...me?",
        "Even though I'm not a songstress anymore? And I don't come from a noble family or have any wealth or land to my name?",
        "You won the war. You could pick anyone in the world. Why would you...",
        "OK. I mean, yes. Yes! I love you madly, and I'd be happy to marry you! But if we're going to be married, I had better think up a cute nickname for you. Don't you think? Oh, I wonder what I should call you now... Darling? My beloved? So many options! I starred in so many operas where I captured the heart of my beloved... But I never dreamed it would be this wonderful when it actually happened.",
        "Hey, Edie! Uh-oh, you're scowling again. You're going to get wrinkles all over that cute face of yours if you don't smile more.",
        "Noble or common, eh? Can you really do that?",
        "Noble or common? And you assume that'll be OK?",
        "I mean, not that I don't agree. I'd make all those nobles vanish if I could...",
        "\"Only\" 1,200 years, huh? You always say such preposterous and extraordinary things, Edie. Yet somehow, you actually make it work for you. It's like you're a character from an opera.",
        "Well, that all sounds pretty violent. But either way, it would make an incredible opera. Do you figure it'd be a grand action piece full of combat and strife? Or would you prefer a somber political drama? ♪ Hail the mighty Edelgard, though red blood stains her story... ♪  ♪ Heavy as her crown may be, she will lead us all to glory... To a brighter dawn, we shall carry on... Hail Edelgard! ♪",
        "♪ Humm, hu-humm, hu-humm... ♪",
        "Yes... I have met someone quite charming recently.",
        "I'm hoping we can spend more time together soon.",
        "Eh, don't worry too much about it, Edie. I'd guess romance isn't really something you're interested in anyway.",
        "Oh, yeah? Is there someone you have your eye on?",
        "That's not surprising. You're not just any old noble, after all. Anyone who has feelings for you... Well, they're in for a pretty complicated life.",
        "That's no way to talk. You meet the right person and boom! You'll have passion to spare. Could be someone you've just met, or someone you've known your whole life... There's no telling how life will go. Something could even spark between the two of us!",
        "Oh yeah? That's awfully sweet of you, Edie.",
        "Hey, Edie, take a look at this! I received it as a gift... It was sent from... Hmm. I don't remember. Anyway, the point is...",
        "You're right. That's a little thoughtless of me.",
        "Oh, don't worry about me. Everything's fine. I'm just not that interested in...certain men. I'm just finding it difficult to care about chasing after love as much as I used to.",
        "Well, I do have an inkling...",
        "No, no, nothing like that. OK, I suppose you're not completely wrong, but...",
        "When the two of us are together, talking like this... Somehow I don't feel like I care about my troubles with love anymore. So, it's fine.",
        "Edie. I'm telling you I'm fine. If you push me any further, I'll write an opera about you. I'll do it right here and now. And then I'll sing it in your face!",
        "Well, I can't promise anything. But if I try real hard, by the time the war is over I might just have an opera written, starring you! No need to worry though, Edie. I'll be fabulous as you. A performance they'll rave about for years.",
        "Why's that?",
        "Edie... You really are something special, aren't you?",
        "Oh, this is lovely... Just feel that breeze.",
        "I was thinking of relaxing here, but it looks as if someone else is lounging in my spot already. taking a nap in public like this? Really, Lin. The nobles look down on such behavior.",
        "Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just teasing. You never do act very noble though. Why is that?",
        "Doesn't that bother you? I mean, really? It doesn't hurt your pride or anything?",
        "First time I've heard a noble say something like that.",
        "I wonder if bad blood between civil and military leaders is somewhat unavoidable. The Minister of Domestic Affairs is in charge of all civil officials, so if they just give in easily, their subordinates would lose respect, right? I get the feeling that if your pride isn't equal to the responsibility you bear, then you aren't fit to lead. Also, I happen to think pride can be quite charming.",
        "If you lack charm, nobody will give you a second glance.",
        "Lin... You can't really believe what you're saying, can you?",
        "Ah! Lin, don't scare me like that!",
        "Don't pretend we're the same. If I could brush it off so easily, I would.",
        "No. Not even a little bit.",
        "Lin. please just...go away. I want to be alone right now.",
        "Please do.",
        "Lin, you got a moment?",
        "Please don't say it like that... I let the gossipers get to me...and I snapped at you. Can you forgive me?",
        "Oh, well... Thank you, I guess.",
        "About the gossip? Not even a little bit. I... I need someone to talk to, and I figure it should be you.",
        "About the things that those soldiers were saying... The truth is, I agree with them. Selfish as I am, I curried favor with a noble so I could enroll here. An orphan like me, here. Crazy, right?",
        "I'm doing the best I can, of course, but sometimes I wonder if it's enough...",
        "But it's my past. You can't escape your past...",
        "That's not living, Lin. It's running away. if I leave my hardships behind, then all of that means nothing.",
        "What an example... I don't quite get it, but I am a bit envious of you. Still, I can't live the way you do.",
        "Heh. Maybe I will.",
        "What's Bern doing? She looks like there's something wrong.",
        "Bern, are you OK?",
        "Just the part about you wishing you could get along with someone. So, Bern, who've you got a crush on? Seriously now, you have to tell me. Who are they? Do I know them? I'm so excited for you, Bern!",
        "Me? I thought we already were friends.",
        "Bern, whatever happened in the past, you know you have my full support. I'm here for you. I thought we'd already been friends for a long time no. Please...",
        "Wait! I...Father? What did she mean by that?",
        "Hello, Bern.",
        "No, not at all. I just want to talk.",
        "Bern, I've just been worried about you. That's all. When I said I was your friend, you ran away, saying something about your father. Remember?",
        "I know you've lived through some bad times. If you could tell me about it, maybe I could help?",
        "Please. Your father's not here now. Whatever it is, you're safe to tell me.",
        "Hang on. Scum? They called me—I mean commoners—they called us scum?",
        "I... I never knew that kind of thing really happened. You hear stories, sure, but... Oh, Bern. I'm so sorry.",
        "I'm proud to be your commoner friend!",
        "Hey now, relax. There's nothing to bawl about. If your dad tried to beat me up, I'd return the favor and then some.",
        "When I was in the opera, you better believe I had run-ins with the most wicked, terrible men. I survived kidnappings, attempted murders, all kinds of stuff. But you know what? I broke those guys' arms. Snap! It was a thank-you for all the trouble they went through trying to hurt me.",
        "So now that you know I can defend myself, can we be friends, Bern?",
        "Petra, how are you doing? Getting used to life here?",
        "I'm glad to hear it. I was so surprised when you first arrived. A princess, all the way from Brigid!",
        "There's nothing to blush about. You're every little girl's dream of what a princess should be. Anyhow, I suppose it's been a long time since you've been back to Brigid, hasn't it? I hope you aren't homesick. Maybe we can cook one of your favorite dishes from back home?",
        "I suppose you're right. That's probably why they don't cook the food of Brigid in the dining hall. I'm sorry. I just got to thinking about how hard it must be to live somewhere so far away from home and... No. It can't be impossible. I'll fix you a real meal of Brigid. I'll just find a recipe and similar ingredients!",
        "Horrendous? Nobody's cooking can be that bad!",
        "Fine. I'll do something instead of cooking for you. I just want to be sure that you feel at home here. How about a massage? That may help you loosen up.",
        "Oh? Then perhaps I could sing you lullabies to help you sleep!",
        "Just know that you never have to worry about putting me out. I like helping my friends. Well then, I must be going, but remember my offer.",
        "You're always trying to become a better fighter. Personally, I am sick of all the battles.",
        "Felix, my goodness, I swear you're always training. Such a hard worker. So strong.",
        "Hello? Felix?",
        "You can hear me. That's good. I was worried maybe your ears didn't work.",
        "Oh nothing...Nothing in particular, I mean. But now that I'm here, and now that you've asked... When you've finished up, do you think you'd like to join me in the dining hall for something sweet?",
        "** : That's not a very nice way to talk to a classmate. Anyway, you sound like you're shooing away a stray cat.",
        "I am not a stray cat, Felix, and I am not leaving until you take a moment to chat with me.",
        "Oh, you better believe I am going to keep doing exactly what I will.",
        "Hmm...Maybe instead of a sweet treat, we can get something spicy? Would you like that? I've heard the dining hall is serving a dish with some western spices in it. Mmm... Does that sound good, Felix? Would you like something spicy instead of sweet?",
        "Well, since you asked so nicely, I'll leave you in peace. Good-bye, Felix!",
        "I'm leaving you alone, just as you asked. I may be walking the same way as you, but--",
        "You've made it abundantly clear I'm not to want anything from you, including politeness.",
        "Nice try, Felix, but it's not like any old noble will do. I just find you interesting is all. Is that so odd?",
        "I've never met a noble so...unsociable. Yes, that's the word. Unsociable. Other nobles are quick to be friends, even if it's just because they might gain something from it.",
        "If they are, so what? You should care how others think of you.",
        "Oh, I agree. What's important isn't how someone looks, it's their true nature. I don't pretend to know your true nature. I don't even have a very good understanding of my own. But I suppose you see mine just fine, don't you? Just a silly girl with no thoughts in her head except for marrying a noble, yes? Good-bye, Felix.",
        "Ingrid? Do you have a moment? We're going to perform an opera in the cathedral.",
        "Yes! It's a small one, but I need some volunteers.",
        "Classic opera fare. A tragic love story. A princess who falls in love with a handsome commoner. But our princess, she carries the fate of her country on her shoulders... And no matter how in love she is, she can't just marry whoever she wants... Or can she?",
        "Me. I was a singer in an opera company, though I hope I'm not being too presumptuous casting myself. Even if you're not interested in being part of the production, you will come to see it, won't you? I'm asking everyone to dress up properly. I want it to be a stylish and elegant night.",
        "Please don't worry if you can't make it. I understand we're doing this on such short notice.",
        "If fashion's your concern, lady, you're in luck.",
        "If you don't dress for the occasion, no one will take you seriously. But don't worry about a thing. I'll happily work my magic on you. When it's time, I'll meet you in your room. We'll make you the most beautiful woman in the theater.",
        "Ingrid, I...am trying to think of something polite to say right now. It's as if you have no experience dressing elegantly. At all.",
        "I'm sorry. I...I shouldn't be so hard on you. I was just surprised, is all. A gal like you? You're a beautiful young noblewoman... Who somehow has no experience with either makeup or fashion. This is basic stuff, Ingrid. The basics of the basics, really. But it's like you've never even tried.",
        "How?",
        "Well, yeah. That's why we dress up when we go out. You might meet someone, and you want to look your best, don't you? Get their attention? Lure them in?",
        "Oh, I just said that so you wouldn't run off screaming.",
        "My real point is that you're quite lovely even before getting all fixed up. Absolutely bewitching, in fact. So when I'm finished with you, well... Someone looking at you could be forgiven for...wanting to pounce.",
        "Oh, I know. That's just before I lunge, I'm gonna ask permission.",
        "Ah, Lorenz. As silver-tongued as ever.",
        "I see the rumors are true. What a shame.",
        "Why, that you are always ready to flirt... Unless she's a commoner. Then you'll bid her good day as quickly as possible. Like you did with me just now. Are we so unpleasant to speak to, us commoners?",
        "I'd think you could find plenty of suitable women even among the masses.",
        "Oh, I can imagine. Well, I suppose that means any friendship between you and I is doomed as well.",
        "You want someone to birth your house's next generation. I want someone to share my life with. I'm not even an option in your eyes, and you are hardly viable in mine. However, we are all friends in here, are't we, so I suppose politeness, at the very least, is in order.",
        "Oh, save it for your noble girls, Lorenz. I'm not in the mood.",
        "And it really was quite wonderful to be so near your elegance. Now, if you'll please excuse me.",
        "Um... all of it? You're no different from the men who flirted with me when I was in the opera. As long as you're getting what you're after, you don't much care what a woman wants, needs or feels.",
        "Oh, have I? Do explain.",
        "You're searching for someone who matches your vision of a perfect spouse? '' ''How odd. So am I. And everyone else.",
        "You're more serious than I thought. And so earnest... It's almost adorable. If you met a peasant girl and fell madly in love, would you be able to give her up? Break her heart?",
        "Lorenz, you are dangerously close to dedicating your life to the lie that nobility is something special... I hope you realize that before it's too late.",
        "Too much fighting. I need a moment's peace...",
        "What are you doing here?",
        "Nothing. Not really. I just need a bit of quiet.",
        "Don't trouble yourself on my account. So, did you ever find that wife you were looking for?",
        "The truth is... I know this is sudden, but there's a war on, and who knows what tomorrow brings, right?",
        "I've always been quite fond of you. But I've also, well... I've given up on you.",
        "You're from a noble family, and I'm a commoner. It would have been scandalous. I did what I could to be worthy of you, but you never noticed... So I've resigned myself to a lonesome life, my feelings unrequited.",
        "I like seeing you flustered, you know that? It makes joking with you so much more fun.",
        "Yes, joking. It used to be my job to pluck at people's heartstrings, remember? And I'm much better at it than you are. Admit it, Sir Lorenz.",
        "You and I both know that doesn't matter. Not really. We can never get married.",
        "You will, huh? Gosh, I sure do hope I'm not already married by then.",
        "Professor Manuela! It's been far too long since we've had a proper chat. Let's fix that right now.",
        "That's something like a rose telling a daisy it's pretty, but I appreciate the compliment all the same.",
        "Oh, stop it. You've accomplished a great deal. You should be proud.",
        "Well, it did require pulling some noble strings. But learning everything to pass the entrance exams? That was all me and very hard. Especially while I was still singing for the opera. But I wanted the academy more than anything else.",
        "Isn't it obvious? Because you were here. When you retired, it broke my heart. But is also woke me up. Seeing someone like you, who shined so brightly on the stage, give it all up and start a brand new life... It got me thinking about my own future, and what I wanted it to look like. As ever, I followed your lead.",
        "**  I had also heard that the heirs to the Alliance, Empire, and the Kingdom were all enrolling this year...",
        "With such an exceptional crop of potential spouses, how could I go anywhere else?",
        "I'm sure I'll find my somebody someday. But I haven't found them yet. Ahh, it's so nice to spend time with you again, Manuela. It's been too long.",
        "Manuela? Oh my goodness! You look terrible. Don't get up. I'll get you some water. I should fluff up those pillows for you. It will make you more comfortable.",
        "You thought you'd hide this from me?",
        "Even when you were still with the opera company, you had quite the reputation. There was a joke that you could outdrink a fish, and the sailor who caught it.",
        "Don't say that! You've not lost a bit of respect from me. Not one bit. Everyone has their faults, and some have more than others, but... You were the finest songstress the opera had ever seen. And you've taught me well. What I really mean to say is... You're my inspiration. I really do admire you.",
        "I do? Oh. Nothing's wrong. Not really. I just... I've just been thinking about the future... and what happens when the war is over.",
        "Well, I'm... not entirely sure. I guess I don't know what to expect. In my life, I've met all sorts of people who've lived lots of different way. So now I'm trying to figure out how I want to live. I'm free, unlike so many people. I have the ability to take control of my own fate. Like you.",
        "Haha, you'll find him. He's out there somewhere... You know, there is one thing I want for the future.",
        "Well, it's a dream I've always had. You'll think this is silly, but... I'd like to stand beside you.",
        "When you left the opera company... I took your place. I stood center stage and sang. And everyone cheered for me. I wish the cheers were for me and you. I wish we stood on that stage together.",
        "Maybe we weren't together then, but we're together here. Now. And, in the future, maybe it won't be so bad if you never find that man of your dreams.",
        "You and me. I won't find a guy either, we can just be together. I think that'd be pretty nice, don't you? Living together, and doing whatever we want.",
        "Sparkling in the stage lights forever.",
        "Nice to see you, Yurikins. I was wondering if you might do me a favor.",
        "It's healing nicely, but I'm not supposed to put too much weight on it.",
        "Not an errand. An opera.",
        "There's been some loose plans for a performance. Nothing professional, strictly volunteer. I signed up to take part as one of the main roles. And then this happened. The professor told me I should bow out, just to be on the safe side.",
        "Got it in one! I'm glad we're on the same page here.",
        "Already tried. Trust me, I wouldn't ask unless I was desperate. I knew how much you'd hate the idea.",
        "Oh, don't worry about that. Most of our audience won't be able to tell the difference. The crowd's going to be a bunch of down-on-their-luck children that the monastery's taken in. I'm only talking about a small festival in the plaza. We want to give them a good show, that's all. You have an idea of what they've been through. I thought you might want to pitch in.",
        "Good for you. I knew you'd rise to the occasion.",
        "Could be! I've never known a songstress who wasn't both beautiful and resourceful. Now, are you ready to go over the libretto? You've got a lot of rehearsing to do before the performance. Seriously, though... Thanks, Yurikins.",
        "All right, Yurikins. Isn't it about time you let go of this grudge?",
        "I'm sorry I dragged you out onto the stage, but I can't believe you're still holding it against me.",
        "Then why do you get this stony look and face the other way any time you catch a glimpse of me?",
        "Huh. I didn't know you were carrying something like that.",
        "That's why you don't like singing? There's got to be more to it than that.",
        "You do what you must to chase your dreams. You say it left you filthy and unlovable, but my life didn't leave me unscathed either. There's not much love left in what I do. There was one, of course. As a child, I lived for singing. No matter how hard times got, I always had that. I counted myself so lucky to have met Manuela and joined the opera. But the more I sang for a living, the less certain I was that I loved it anymore.",
        "You might be onto something. I felt... genuinely happy in that moment.",
        "That's... a great idea, actually. We'll start something new together. You and me.",
        "The world is full of people who fell through the cracks, just like us. We'll take them in whenever we can and aim to become Fodlan's premier opera company. I can't remember the last time I was this fired up! Though we'll have to table it until after the war.",
        "Leave it to you to take all the romance out of it! But I know you're an idealist deep down.",
        "I'll take that as a compliment. I could say the same for you too. It's exactly why I'm comfortable sharing this dream with you."

    "Edelgard": [
        "Professor... What are you doing here?",
        "Ah... So you heard me, then. Yes, it was a nightmare. I've had them since I was a child. Stupid, pointless dreams I can't control... It's terribly frustrating.",
        "But only if you swear not to tell a soul.",
        "I appreciate it. I dream of...my older brother, paralyzed, helpless... my older sister crying for help that never came... the youngest babbling words beyond meaning. I see my family dying slowly, waiting in the darkest depths for a glimmer of light. I once had ten siblings, eight older and two younger. Such a large family, and yet I became the heir to the throne. Do you know why? Every last one of them was crippled by disease or lost their mind or died. I was the only one left who could inherit the throne.",
        "Things kept getting worse. The darkness kept getting darker. In the end, I was the only one who survived. The nightmares are a reminder...to never forget. To never allow such terrible things to happen again.",
        "Even now, I'm the only one who can carry the weight of the Adrestian Empire. The future of the Empire...of everything...depends on me. Hm... I shared more than I intended to. I suppose there's something in the air tonight. I've never told anyone about my past before. Please... forget I said anything. Sleep well, my teacher.",
        "Ah, it's you. Out late again, I see. What brings you here?",
        "I should get some sleep too, but... Have you ever felt a sort of longing for the outdoors? I have. There are times I long for the warmth of the sun, for a sweet breeze on my face... Do you remember what I told you the other night? About...my past? None of my siblings had a chance to lead the sort of life they deserved. An ordinary life.",
        "My siblings and I were... We were imprisoned underground, beneath the palace. The object was to endow our bodies with the power of a Major Crest. I have always possessed the Crest of Seiros, inherited through the Hresvelg bloodline. But it was only a Minor Crest, and most of my siblings bore no Crest at all. In order to create a peerless emperor to rule Fódlan, they violated our bodies by cutting open our very flesh. Now here I stand, the fruit of that endeavor: Edelgard von Hresvelg! But that came at too high a price... The others were sacrificed. Ours weren't the only lives devastated by that terrible process. Innocents died as well, without even knowing what they were dying for. And there you have it, the truth of the Hresvelg's Empire.",
        "I know how it all sounds. But when you see my true strength, you will know I speak the truth. I have kept it hidden all this time, but...I will reveal to you the power of my second Crest.",
        "It is the same as yours...the Crest of Flames. When it manifested for me, I swore a silent oath. For the sake of my family and for all the poor souls whose lives were traded for my existence... For their sake, I will build a world where such meaningless sacrifice is never again sanctioned. As emperor, I will change the world. I swear it.",
        "'''' Ugh... I'm so sick of it all. There is so much to be done, yet all I encounter are new problems and pitfalls. Ugh... Sometimes I wish I could spend just one day doing absolutely nothing and gorging myself on sweets!",
        "But...Hubert would never allow it.",
        "Indeed. It may not be possible now, but one day we will know the joys of idling. Mark my words.",
        "'''' Is that a smirk I spy? Is it so amusing to you, me daydreaming of free time?",
        "But let's put that aside for now. There is something I've been meaning to tell you.",
        "'''' I'm afraid this might sound a bit...sentimental. However...",
        "I want to thank you. Because of you, I feel I can walk my fated path without losing myself. If I were alone, I might have lost perspective and become a harsh ruler with a heart of ice. But I'm not alone. With you by my side, I'm somehow free to be not only a leader but... simply Edelgard.",
        "Until now, no. one has been able to surpass me—much less command me. I have always been seen as an untouchable princess or emperor. No one spoke to me as an equal or met my gaze without flinching. It was lonely. Terribly lonely. The only person I could rely on as I tried to claw my way out of the darkness was myself. But you...you have been a brilliant light. Somehow, you have chased the darkness away. And for that... I will always be grateful.",
        "Yes? Oh! It's you, Professor. I was certain it was Hubert coming to drag me back to my duties.",
        "'''' \"Your Majesty, you must know your supreme talents are needed at present. Why not gaze at these documents instead of the sky?\"",
        "But that's enough about Hubert for the moment. While I have your attention, I'd like to thank you for your help in that last battle. As you well know, I'm perfectly capable of commanding the army by myself. However, when you're around, it's somehow different. I'm not sure I can properly explain it. I suppose your perspective on the battlefield is simply sharper than mine. When you're devising tactics and tricks for us, it's almost as though you can read the enemy's mind. There's no getting around it. Your talent for strategy far exceeds my own. I'm quite jealous in all honesty.",
        "Is that a fact? Well, if you insist. I suppose a flower from another's field is always more beautiful. I'll admit, I think of you as rather detached, so to hear that you have emotions such as jealousy is... something of a relief.",
        "Friends... That word somehow doesn't seem adequate. Besides, we've been friends for a long time, you and I. By now, we're so much more than that, at least in my mind. You know...instead of Edelgard, you can call me just El. If you so please.",
        "That's what my parents and closest sisters used to call me when I was little. Now there's no one left who calls me El... But with you, well...I think I could allow it. In fact, it would mean a great deal to me.",
        "Why? Hmm...",
        "Well, you have stood beside me and shared my burdens. As I said, you are much more than a friend. In truth, you are like family to me. I suppose that's why.",
        "The children of the goddess have been defeated at last. The shape of the world will be forever changed. Humanity is free now. The world is ours once again. Can you believe it?",
        "I don't know what the future holds, but...come what may, will you stay by my side? You chose to protect me at the Holy Tomb. Will you choose me again?",
        "What I'm trying to say is...I need you.",
        "You called me El. That's... I... That means more than I can say.",
        "And this ring... It's lovely. {{Hover|Thank you, my dearest friend. I will happily accept it.|Note: This is a mistranslation. In the Japanese version, Edelgard says, \"Thank you, my teacher.\"}}",
        "I must admit, I feared my feelings would be unrequited. So long as I had you by my side, it never mattered how many enemies I amassed. You were all I needed. All this time, I longed to share my feelings with you, and it seems you wished for the same. Now, our wishes have come true. This feeling... it's overwhelming.",
        "We will crush those who slither in the dark and restore peace and order to Fódlan. I will then find a suitable successor and hand over the reins of the Empire.",
        "'''To think that I may truly call you my partner and equal now... The solitary reign of Edelgard has come to an end. From now on, we walk this path together. With time and care, the darkness shrouding this world will be lifted. You and I will become the light that shines over Fódlan... just as you have shined upon my life.'''",

But I'm not alone. With you by my side, I'm somehow free to be not only a leader but... simply Edelgard.",
        "True. I am fortunate to be surrounded by many wonderful companions. Nevertheless, you are...different from the rest.",
        "Until now, no. one has been able to surpass me—much less command me. I have always been seen as an untouchable princess or emperor. No one spoke to me as an equal or met my gaze without flinching. It was lonely. Terribly lonely. The only person I could rely on as I tried to claw my way out of the darkness was myself. But you...you have been a brilliant light. Somehow, you have chased the darkness away. And for that... I will always be grateful.",
        "Yes? Oh! It's you, Professor. I was certain it was Hubert coming to drag me back to my duties.",
        "'''' \"Your Majesty, you must know your supreme talents are needed at present. Why not gaze at these documents instead of the sky?\"",
        "But that's enough about Hubert for the moment. While I have your attention, I'd like to thank you for your help in that last battle. As you well know, I'm perfectly capable of commanding the army by myself. However, when you're around, it's somehow different. I'm not sure I can properly explain it. I suppose your perspective on the battlefield is simply sharper than mine. When you're devising tactics and tricks for us, it's almost as though you can read the enemy's mind. There's no getting around it. Your talent for strategy far exceeds my own. I'm quite jealous in all honesty.",
        "Is that a fact? Well, if you insist. I suppose a flower from another's field is always more beautiful. I'll admit, I think of you as rather detached, so to hear that you have emotions such as jealousy is... something of a relief.",
        "Friends... That word somehow doesn't seem adequate. Besides, we've been friends for a long time, you and I. By now, we're so much more than that, at least in my mind. You know...instead of Edelgard, you can call me just El. If you so please.",
        "That's what my parents and closest sisters used to call me when I was little. Now there's no one left who calls me El... But with you, well...I think I could allow it. In fact, it would mean a great deal to me.",
        "Why? Hmm...",
        "Well, you have stood beside me and shared my burdens. As I said, you are much more than a friend. In truth, you are like family to me. I suppose that's why.",
        "The children of the goddess have been defeated at last. The shape of the world will be forever changed. Humanity is free now. The world is ours once again. Can you believe it?",
        "I don't know what the future holds, but...come what may, will you stay by my side? You chose to protect me at the Holy Tomb. Will you choose me again?",
        "What I'm trying to say is...I need you.",
        "You called me El. That's... I... That means more than I can say.",
        "And this ring... It's lovely. {{Hover|Thank you, my dearest friend. I will happily accept it.|Note: This is a mistranslation. In the Japanese version, Edelgard says, \"Thank you, my teacher.\"}}",
        "I must admit, I feared my feelings would be unrequited. So long as I had you by my side, it never mattered how many enemies I amassed. You were all I needed. All this time, I longed to share my feelings with you, and it seems you wished for the same. Now, our wishes have come true. This feeling... it's overwhelming.",
        "We will crush those who slither in the dark and restore peace and order to Fódlan. I will then find a suitable successor and hand over the reins of the Empire.",
        "'''To think that I may truly call you my partner and equal now... The solitary reign of Edelgard has come to an end. From now on, we walk this path together. With time and care, the darkness shrouding this world will be lifted. You and I will become the light that shines over Fódlan... just as you have shined upon my life.'''",
        "Sometimes I wonder if your life could have taken you down a different path. If you had never met me and entered my service, you might have had a more peaceful—",
        "I understand you well. Better than anyone.",
        "I feel the same way.",
        "I see. Then I won't speak of such things again. If it's really what you want, I'll gladly keep you by my side. The path I must walk...is soaked in blood. It's a path that can lead to madness, can snatch away one's future, and can even take one's life. And the pool of blood at my feet is growing larger. Those stains can never be washed clean.",
        "We've come such a long way. After all, I was only four years old when we first met.",
        "Please don't mock me with such frivolous praise. I can hardly recall that day.",
        "I had no idea. But House Vestra has served House Hresvelg for generations... Given that, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.",
        "Ah, when my uncle, Lord Arundel, defected to the Kingdom and took me with him.",
        "I've never heard that story before. So there are things you've never told me.",
        "That's beside the point. I wish to know these things. If there's anything else you're keeping from me, please tell me at once.",
        "Why? It's a simple order. I really must kn—",
        "Wait just a moment! I just hope he's not hiding anything too worrisome...",
        "Hubert. I can't shake the feeling that you're keeping more secrets from me.",
        "I remember. However, I am the emperor now. If the Minister of the Imperial Household does not obey his orders, I have the right to execute him.",
        "I see. Then you are unwilling to obey my orders as emperor?",
        "You know I would never do such a thing and that I pay no heed to the title you bear. It is your own presence and capabilities that I value so highly, Hubert. Titles are meaningless next to such things. Our families have no bearing on this matter...nor does the Empire itself.",
        "As emperor, I'm obliged to accept that answer. However, as your friend, it irritates me to no end. You speak often of painting the path I walk, yet you do so in secret. I am the one you serve, but you refuse to let me in. I trust you, Hubert, and that is precisely why I want to know everything, your secret hopes and burdens. All of it. If I'm truly the center of your world, then I wish you would trust me as well as I trust you.",
        "Wait a moment. Are you saying...you have romantic feelings for someone?",
        "Well, that's utter nonsense! You can't possibly keep something so fascinating from me! Who is it?",
        "Heh, Hubert... You never cease to surprise me.",
        "Is that so...",
        "Was the emperor of the time. She wagered the throne in a duel against Derick and won. \"Why don't we do what our ancestors did and have a little duel ourselves?\" That's what you were going to say, but the answer is no.",
        "My apologies, Ferdinand.",
        "Ferdinand, control yourself. When will you tire of challenging me in pointless competitions?",
        "You expect me to believe that?",
        "I'm afraid to ask what you could possibly mean by that...",
        "This has to stop. Ugh, perhaps I should have ended things with a duel after all...",
        "Standing tall, I see...",
        "Ah, what a lovely bloom...",
        "Ferdinand. Stop. I can't believe you're wasting my time with a petty, one-sided rivalry.",
        "I've had enough of your foolish antics! Very well. I will grant you the duel you so desperately desire. But when I win, you must forfeit the right to bother me with your ridiculousness. Forever. Do we have a deal?",
        "As you wish.",
        "Hya!",
        "I can't afford to hold back against an opponent like you. I led with my fastest, strongest strike.",
        "The difference in our skill level is not so great as all that. If you had taken the first strike, you might have won. That's why I didn't give you the chance.",
        "Ferdinand...",
        "Hello, Ferdinand. You seem to be in a good mood.",
        "Have you now? Well, I'm glad to hear it.",
        "You really are in a good mood. Your determination is admirable.",
        "Ferdinand... There's something I've been meaning to say to you for a while now. Honestly, I couldn't care less that you are of noble birth. Your fierce determination doesn't come from your bloodline. It's your own doing. The reason I value you and want to be friends with you is because of who you are, not who your family is.",
        "Heh, so you're saying that the kind of world I'm striving to create is wrong?",
        "Finding a way to educate the people... Interesting. I'm impressed by how much thought you've given this. No matter what shape the world takes, I'm sure I'll always need people like you by my side. People with strong principles who will argue with me and force me to consider ideas that are contrary to my own.",
        "I've always thought of you as a valued friend, Ferdinand. That's nothing new.",
        "Halt, Ferdinand! There's a time and a place for everything...but that time is not now.",
        "**  You could say that. I'm looking for someone named Linhardt who's been skipping lectures again.",
        "What else could bring me here other than your complete negligence?",
        "Before you go on, is there any discernible benefit to me allowing this babble to continue?",
        "And that would be?",
        "That's it?",
        "You know, if you ever truly applied yourself, you could become a distinguished scholar. You could use your Crest knowledge to benefit the world or uncover new discoveries in magic theory.",
        "There's nothing wrong with a selfish drive for knowledge but only if you put it to good use.",
        "Oh? Then please, tell me what potential uses you have in mind.",
        "A lullaby? Ugh, I have things to do. Just know that this was my last warning.",
        "Linhardt, at least try to do some training. Use a staff or a rod or a broom, for all I care.",
        "You slept through the whole debate, didn't you? Fine. I'll summarize it for you.",
        "There you are. Don't tell me you were sneaking out to do some training...",
        "A mere coincidence. Why would you wish to hide from me?",
        "To ensure that your talent is not wasted due to your lack of—",
        "Wh...what is the matter with you?",
        "How so?",
        "That's taking it a bit far, don't you think?",
        "I see. Very well. You've made your perspective perfectly clear.",
        "Linhardt! I've finally found you.",
        "Perhaps another time. Right now, I have something to discuss with you. You've said before that you don't care about the usefulness of your research. After giving it some thought, I decided that I'd like to create an institution for Crest and Relic research, and I'd like for you to lead it. All you would need to do is carry out whatever research you like. Somebody else will decide how to make use of your findings. What do you think? I imagine such an environment would suit you quite well.",
        "Why are you skeptical about my proposal?",
        "Well then, I suppose I should be grateful. But I'll be honest. I see little point in bringing you on board if you're so troubled by the idea. Let's put this idea on hold for the moment. I'll figure something out for you by the war's end. I have great respect for your talent, Linhardt. I'm certain I can find a way to make use of it that's to your liking.",
        "Here again, I see.",
        "Understandably. Now, about my proposal to create an institution for Crest and Relic research... I've decided to move forward with it. As for who will lead the charge...",
        "Actually, no. I was just considering some conditions for whoever applies for the job.",
        "To start, I won't allow the position to be a secondary one. That excludes lords who are busy looking after their own territories.",
        "Quite the opposite. I'm looking for applicants with enough passion for the job that they're willing to relinquish any land-holding rights they possess. They will be provided with necessities like food, clothing, and housing but will receive no further compensation. That said, they will be free to take as much time off as they desire.",
        "That's my hope.",
        "Why must I what?",
        "I told you I'd figure out a way to make use of your talents that you'd find acceptable.",
        "Then have you decided?",
        "Training again? You're certainly working hard, Caspar.",
        "I did, but no matter. What has you training with such intensity? It's never good to neglect one's training, but overdoing it is ill-advised as well. You could already give any student here a battle they wouldn't soon forget.",
        "If memory serves, you're the second son of House Bergliez, right?",
        "I understand. It's difficult being born a noble. Those who inherit everything also inherit great burdens, but the same can be said of those who inherit nothing.",
        "**  Are you picking a fight, Caspar?",
        "Ugh, I have no desire to bicker with you. Good luck with your training. Good-bye.",
        "Caspar, I've been wondering something. Would you be happier if you were the heir to House Bergliez?",
        "You may not want to hear this, but your brother is not a good man. He's lazy and greedy and has always relied on the knowledge that he would inherit a title. That's my impression of him, anyway.",
        "That's the price of taking your own desires into account when choosing an heir. The concept of nobility is decaying, and it's dragging the Empire into the ground with it.",
        "It must. I intend to create a world where the best are free to rise to the top and succeed, regardless of their bloodline. The nobility as it is now could not exist in a world like that. I'll make sure of it.",
        "If you were the best suited for that position, I would.",
        "Is that so?",
        "Hm? Why do you ask?",
        "Heh, you can seem rather oblivious, but then you go and shock me with your keen insight.",
        "Is it? You only have yourself to blame for the reputation. As for me, I've always thought of you as something of a victim.",
        "I mean you're a victim of Fódlan's antiquated system of nobility. You're skilled and you work hard, yet you still play second fiddle to your less capable older brother. Even still, you fight on not allowing yourself to be discouraged by it all. People like you help to fuel my fire. If I can only smash this rotten system, I could save you.",
        "Just hear me out. I've realized...that I was wrong about you. I can now see that you've found a way to live the life you want to live. Simply put, you love working hard, and you love training. You don't know the meaning of surrender. I never thought such a genuine person could really exist.",
        "It doesn't matter that you have burdens to bear. Despite that, you never stray from your path. You don't let anything tie you down. I can hardly imagine a life like that. To be honest, I'm a bit jealous.",
        "Is that so?",
        "That's true. I certainly make mistakes, but I feel it's important to own up to them.",
        "This is no laughing matter, Caspar. Then again, that's part of how you choose to live as well, isn't it?",
        "Heh heh, I don't doubt it. The future is ours, Caspar. I'm counting on you to help clear the way.",
        "Bernadetta, why are you following me?",
        "You were following me quite conspicuously, so why attempt to hide now?",
        "Um?",
        "Calm yourself. I have no reason to harm you.",
        "Bernadetta.",
        "Please explain why you were following me, and why you tried to hide.",
        "Please speak like the human you are. I already said no harm will come to you.",
        "And that explains it...how?",
        "Honestly. Look, nobody is truly fearless. Even I have things that I'm afraid of.",
        "You seem oddly overjoyed at the thought.",
        "The sea. I find the pitch black of the open sea at night quite frightening. I can't swim, so if the sea were to wash me away, I fear I would never return.",
        "Again, my shortcomings delight you. Everyone has fears, as well as things they can't do. How many times must I tell you?",
        "Bernadetta.",
        "I appreciate all the effort you're making to overcome your fear of me. Your dedication is commendable. However...",
        "Bernadetta!",
        "The problem you keep running into is that you don't listen to what people are really saying. That's why your efforts are in vain. You need to listen instead of jumping to your own conclusions.",
        "Are you...listening to me?",
        "Then why aren't you responding?",
        "I was.",
        "By all means. But please try to make it a fairly quiet one.",
        "You're trying your best. I know that. But even so—",
        "Wait, you didn't let me finish! I was only going to say that—",
        "I feel the same. You know so much about it, Bernadetta.",
        "They are sweet. Unlike people, they can all be trusted on sight.",
        "Well, I'll strive to avoid getting angry.",
        "I'm glad too. I had heard about the reclusive daughter of House Varley, but you're nothing like I imagined.",
        "Heh, there's no need to be embarrassed! Rumors are meaningless. All that matters is the truth.",
        "I'm happy to hear it. Actually...I should thank you.",
        "That mind of yours—no! I mean the grateful sort of thanks. Before I met you, I was more prone to anger. But now I've changed in that regard. So thank you for that. Oh... I suppose you're not listening.",
        "It's OK, Bernadetta. I'm thanking you, not attacking you.",
        "You did, yes. But don't worry about it. Enough talk, don't you think? Let's take care of these sweet little plants.",
        "Bernadetta... I hope you'll keep spending time with me.",
        "Ha! So it is! I can't wait to see its true colors...",
        "Hello, Dorothea. I was just lost in thought. There are so many things to be done—to think of them makes my head ache sometimes. So many nobles of the Empire are utterly useless.",
        "**  It's not a question of can or cannot. All that matters is doing it and doing it right. The nobility system has only been around for twelve-hundred years. The concept didn't exist before that.",
        "A character from an opera... Hm. If an opera is made about my life someday, I wonder how I'll be portrayed.",
        "That's quite enough, Dorothea. I'm starting to feel more than a little embarrassed. Lovely as your voice is, let's just hope that any operatic productions about me are still a ways off.",
        "You're in high spirits today, Dorothea.",
        "Well, I wish you the best of luck. I wish I had some advice to offer. Alas... I do not.",
        "I'm not completely disinterested.",
        "Hmm...",
        "True. And I can't ignore the possibility that I may have to marry for political purposes. I doubt I'll ever have the opportunity for a passionate romance as long as I live...",
        "You and I? Now that is an entertaining thought. If such an exciting future is in store, I look forward to it!",
        "Dorothea... When you receive a gift, don't you think you should try to remember who it's from?",
        "What's gotten into you lately? You seem mostly uninterested in the various suitors throwing themselves at you. Is something on your mind?",
        "Do you have any idea why?",
        "You seem reluctant to tell me... Is it somehow my fault?",
        "How do you mean? Please, just say what's on your mind.",
        "Hmm... There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but it seems we should get to the bottom of such a drastic change. Maybe we can figure it out if we just—",
        "Settle down, Dorothea, I can take a hint! If you insist, I'll drop the subject. Whatever you do, don't write more opera lines about me. My cheeks are probably still red from your last performance.",
        "Ugh, the frightening part is that I don't know whether you're joking or not. But I do regret to inform you that you won't be playing the role of Edelgard.",
        "Don't you see? No story about me would be complete without the character of Dorothea. It would be ridiculous for you to play me instead of yourself.",
        "Petra... You seem to be flourishing in your new environment. Is all going well for you?",
        "I'm glad to hear it. After all, a Brigid royal like yourself is of vital importance to the future of the Empire. If you ever need anything, please let me know. It's my job to watch out for you, after all.",
        "I don't doubt it. Perhaps I'm worrying too much. I just don't know what I would say to your family if something were to happen to you.",
        "There is certainly truth in your words.",
        "Tell me, Petra... Who do you think I am?",
        "I will tell you. I am Edelgard von Hresvelg. And yes, I'm attempting to do what no one else can. I'm prepared to shoot two birds, or even three, with a single arrow. That is the least of the impossible things I will accomplish. If you don't need my patronage, then prove it. Show me your power. Never settle for being the bird. Be the arrow instead.",
        "Well, if you intend to shadow us like that, you can be sure it won't escape our notice. Hubert was primed and ready to...remove you. I ordered him to stand down.",
        "Two pheasants? Are you implying that...",
        "That's astounding, Petra! Hmm, it's perhaps a bit late to explain now, but what I was getting at earlier was actually...",
        "You... Come again?",
        "Did you now?",
        "Heh. Yes, that much is certain. I can see that you no longer need me to look out for you. You and I are much the same. We dutifully shoulder our burdens and stand tall no matter what. It would be foolish of me to deny it.",
        "A cheap trick, to be sure. But inarguably funny. To think that you went to all the trouble of shooting two pheasants at once for the sake of a joke. Heh... Well played, Petra.",
        "Lysithea? Are you all right? You don't look well...",
        "You were cleaning the library...all by yourself?",
        "So many books... You probably tired yourself out just moving them from the shelves.",
        "Well... Maybe you should think things through a little more next time. Surely you can tell how much physical strength a job is going to require before you begin.",
        "I only said that you should take care of yourself. Especially considering—",
        "Nothing. Never mind. How about you return to your quarters? I'll finish cleaning up in here.",
        "I don't mind, really. Please, don't make me repeat myself.",
        "I will. Get some rest, OK?",
        "If what I heard about Lysithea is true... Hmm... I just don't know how much of it I should believe.",
        "You want to speak with me? How unusual... Please, come in. I'll prepare some tea for us.",
        "Have a seat. Would you care for some cake?",
        "They're from Enbarr. A bit too sweet for my own liking.",
        "Heh, true. Well, there's no shortage of them. Help yourself to as many as you like. Now then. You wished to speak with me?",
        "Maybe this can wait until you've finished eating?",
        "What in particular?",
        "Oh? That's...hard to believe.",
        "Actually, this is the first I'm hearing of it. How would I know unless you told me?",
        "Either way... I know now since you just told me. About your two Crests, your physical weakness, and your short life expectancy. However, according to the principles of Crest research, it's impossible to bear two Crests. Unless...you've undergone a blood reconstruction surgery. Is that the case, Lysithea?",
        "I see. So you've lived through that relentless terror and agony...and survived.",
        "You're a good friend, Lysithea. And a valuable member of this army. So I won't have you overexerting yourself. I don't want to lose you. Understand?",
        "Heh. Good girl. Oh, and if you like those cakes, why not take some with you for later?",
        "How are you today, Lysithea?",
        "Quite well, thank you.",
        "It's true. My aim is to dismantle the current system of aristocracy. The only reason nobles enjoy the status they do is because their bloodlines carry Crests. If Crests lose their value, so will titles of nobility.",
        "Lysithea...",
        "Huh?",
        "Understood. I promise to do all I can to see this goal to fruition. And I want you to promise something in return... that you will never stop fighting for your life. Whatever terrible fate awaits us, we can fight it and prevail! I need you to trust me on that. Do you promise?",
        "Good girl. Now then...would you care for a sweet cake?",
        "Professor Hanneman, may I have a moment of your time?",
        "I'll pass on that offer. I'm just hoping you'll explain something to me.",
        "Why did you abandon your noble standing in the Empire? And don't say it was for your Crest research. There are institutes for that within the Empire. You could easily have remained a noble and still been able to visit Garreg Mach or request the cooperation of the church.",
        "But surely your noble status would have allowed you greater funding and resources. Even secrets of the Kingdom and the Alliance would have been easier to obtain as a noble of the Empire.",
        "Hmm... I see you're unwilling to be forthcoming on that topic.",
        "I've heard that you used to enthusiastically research Crests for the Empire. You abandoned the Empire yet retained your focus on Crest research. I just wanted to know why.",
        "That's right. When I was a student, I avoided this place. I couldn't allow the church to learn of my Crests, after all.",
        "I suppose so. Though I'm still bothered by certain things.",
        "Well, we're fighting to free the world from the church's control and to unify Fódlan. You must have some idea of what the world I'm seeking to create will be like.",
        "Precisely. Our current system is founded on the fact that Crests are inherited through blood. If we shatter the status quo so that those without Crests are no longer at the mercy of those with them, the very concept of nobility will vanish.",
        "Perhaps the fate of the nobility is of no consequence to you, but what about that of Crests? You've devoted your life to unraveling their secrets. Whereas I seek to create a world where Crests are no longer valued. In fact, I would prefer to rid the world of them entirely if at all possible. Does this not concern you?",
        "I see...",
        "Professor Hanneman, I...I owe you an apology.",
        "Ah, so you knew. You're right... I'm afraid I found it difficult to quell my doubts.",
        "Your father bore a Major Crest, and both you and your grandfather inherited Minor Crests. Your sister was born without one...but as the daughter of a family in which Crests are prevalent, others saw...potential in her. That's why she was married off to a certain noble whose influence was waning. He was undoubtedly desperate for power. But no matter how many children she bore him, none manifested a Crest. She fell from her husband's favor and was mistreated...ultimately leading to...",
        "That's why you abandoned your position in the Empire and came to Garreg Mach.",
        "A world in which anyone can bear a Crest... That's not so different from a world with no Crests at all.",
        "Professor Hanneman, please, say no more. I've made peace with my past. Now, I look only to the future. To the world we're fighting to create.",
        "Thank you... That means a great deal to me. Your knowledge and your experience are both invaluable. And your passion too. I welcome your support. And in turn, I will do my best to earn the trust you have placed in me.",
        "That song...",
        "Professor Manuela, that song you were humming... I feel as though I've heard it before, long ago. And I'm sure it was you singing it back then...at the opera house in the Imperial capital, perhaps?",
        "So it was you. I went to that performance with my uncle. I wanted desperately to see it again, but after that night, he took me to seek asylum in the Kingdom... When I returned to the Empire several years later, you had already retired.",
        "Sadly, that's correct.",
        "That's how much of an impression your voice left on me. I must ask... Why did you retire so soon? You could have continued for another 10 or 20 years.",
        "So despite your belief in the goddess, you wished to live by your own strength?",
        "Professor Manuela? May I come in?",
        "Uh... This room! What...what happened here?!",
        "No, I just— Can I help you tidy up? Actually, I have to know. How did you make such a mess in the first place?",
        "Oh, right. Well, let's see what we can do about it.",
        "I heard that you haven't been acting like yourself, so I came to see if you're doing all right. But the moment I saw you, I could tell you were troubled, so it seemed pointless to ask.",
        "I don't need a reward, but...if you wouldn't mind answering my question, I'd greatly appreciate it.",
        "I once asked you why you chose to retire. You said that the goddess supports you emotionally, but it's up to you to take care of the rest. I have to admit that I don't quite understand what you meant by that... Can you please explain?",
        "What happened during that time?",
        "Ah, I see I was wrong about something. I thought that being a devout believer implied a certain weakness of spirit. An inability to survive on your own. But you've proven me wrong, Professor Manuela.",
        "Right you are. I appreciate your concern.",
        "In here, I'm trapped in a whirlwind of political affairs. I just needed to escape for a moment to get some fresh air.",
        "To be honest...I still can't forget what you told me before. I don't want you to misunderstand and think I'm against everything the church represents. There's good there, buried in the corruption. Still... I find it extremely difficult to step back and accept the good, overlooking all the rest. For the world to start anew, it's necessary for the nobility system and the Church of Seiros to both be completely crushed.",
        "I believe so, but...then I think about people like you who are devoted to the goddess. People who are unlike the others, who are willing to fight for themselves rather than leaving everything in the hands of a higher power... When I achieve my aim, I'll be crushing their... crushing your emotional and spiritual support. Yet despite all that, you're still here. Still supporting me.",
        "You're too kind.",
        "I... What do you mean by that?",
        "Ugh, now I'm blushing. Let's change the subject, shall we?",
        "Is this what you wished to show me? I must admit I've never seen such a thing. Is it still potable?",
        "Then I suppose you wouldn't mind taking the first sip.",
        "That was amusing, Constance, but out with it. What was that favor you wished to ask of me?",
        "I had a feeling that was it. I wish I could help, but you must understand my present circumstances...",
        "I agree that you are remarkable. That is beyond question. But how do you imagine rainbow tea will help me to achieve my aim?",
        "It's a most worthy party trick, yes. But I have no use for such a thing.",
        "Constance... There's something important that I would like to talk with you about.",
        "Hm. I must admit, your words strike a chord. I find myself oddly moved by your proclamation."

        "I thought I heard someone. Are you here to train?",
        "Care to train with me? Waving this sword around alone is boring. And I'm tired of crossing swords with worthless opponents. But you seem like a worthy adversary.",
        "You learned from the former captain of the Knights of Seiros, and traveled Fódlan fighting as a mercenary.[On top of that, you wield a Hero's Relic, the legendary Sword of the Creator.] Good sparring partners like you don't grow on trees. But know that I will beat you, and I will surpass your strength.",
        "Why? Hm. I never really thought about that. I learned to thrust a sword before I learned to write my name. Of course, my upbringing wasn't unique. That's how it is for all children in my country. You're of no use if you can't swing a sword, however mighty your Crest may be. It was the perfect environment for me. I could live free of stodgy values and virtues. Grow strong so you may live, and live to grow stronger. That's what I was taught.",
        "But that's enough idle chatter. Take out your sword. My mind is emptied of all but the thrill of the challenge!",
        "You're certainly not going easy on me. You fight like a mercenary, not a knight. You hunger for victory, pure and simple. You may not be aware of it yourself, but I see it.",
        "Knights ought to have some hunger. I've always thought so. They depend too much on their swords. Only when they're wrested away do knights consider their hands and feet as weapons. That's not how it was for warriors of old. They weren't limited by their tools. Victory is what matters, not the method of achieving it. That's the attitude to adopt. I detect that in your style. It is plain to see.",
        "You may take it however you like. I believe the difference between us lies within that hunger. But where does it come from? From the start, I was aiming to win, yet I couldn't defeat you. Then I remembered something you said before...",
        "Indeed. I was raised to value strength above all else. Whereas you had a reason, an ambition, pushing you toward that hunger. So, tell me. What was the reason? Why were you driven to become so strong?",
        "So that is the source of your hunger. I suppose I must find my own.",
        "Ah, if we're to get along, I think not. I'll be content if you continue to train with me. Perhaps it will come to me as I swing my sword.",
        "Finally, I notched a win against you.",
        "When we spar, I feel like I'm revisiting my past.",
        "It's like training with my brother. He always won—always—and died before I could win a single bout. From the first time I held a sword, all I wanted was to surpass him. And that's what drove me to become so strong. Perhaps it's absurd to say such a thing, but... I've spent all these years training for a duel with a corpse.",
        "I can never again spar with my brother. Not unless he climbs out of his grave. Still, I continue my endless pursuit of strength. Maybe because I have a new opponent to measure myself against.",
        "You. Obviously. I beat you this time, but when we next cross swords, who knows what might happen? It was a close match, not a crushing victory. I know that I can do better. I will surpass you in strength, and then I'll become stronger still.",
        "Anyway, thank you...for helping me find an answer to the question you asked, all those years ago.",

        "Anyway, thank you...for helping me find an answer to the question you asked, all those years ago.",
        "Finally, you came. Wars begin and end, but this place never changes. And you don't change either.",
        "We fought to bring peace to Fódlan, but peace is so boring. No more chances to swing my sword at enemies. No more life-threatening battles. I know that these are positive developments, but I'm still a warrior at heart. Here I am, watching sadly as my blade grows dull.",
        "And on that note, I'll tell you why I asked you to come here. Take this.",
        "Without a worthy opponent like you at my side, not only will my sword grow dull...it'll rust. So I had to think of a way to make sure you'd always be with me. This is what I came up with. And...",
        "You're pretty slow on the uptake. Don't you know what this ring means?",
        "If you keep messing around, I'll... I'll... Fine! Listen carefully. I'm not going to say this more than once. I want you to be my wife. Please say yes. Let's get married and stay together until we die. I love you.",
        "That's all.",
        "'''What? You have something to complain about?'''",
        "'''Oh... OK, then. In that case, I'd better start planning for the future. My future...with you.'''",
        "Oh, look who it is.",
        "Besides, what are you doing here?",
        "Hm. Have you heard the legend of the Goddess Tower? That if you make a pledge, it will be fulfilled? Childish, I know. But if it were true... Let's make a pledge to the goddess. I pledge that someday, I will surpass you. I'll surpass your technique, your skill with the sword, and your cunning as a warrior. Then I will make you taste defeat!",
        "What a disappointment. If you're looking for a passionate affair, you've got the wrong man. Go find someone else. I've spent my life avoiding love and romance. They're distractions. Blades, blood, and battle. That's what I'm made of and nothing else. If someone saw us, however, this may look like an amorous meeting. You'll have to settle for being mistaken as my lover.",
        "It's time I went back to training. I'll always be more comfortable holding a sword than a woman's hand. Try not to catch a cold up here. I'd hate for such a good sparring partner to be out of commission. Good-bye.",
        "Go away. Just looking at your face makes me wanna retch.",
        "Shut up. And stop walking around on your hind legs. You're not fooling me.",
        "Because I know what you really are—a beast, craving blood.",
        "I am. The way you suppressed that rebellion... It was ruthless slaughter and you loved every second. I remember the way you killed your victims. How you watched them suffer. And your face...that expression. All the world's evil packed into it. That was our first battle. I remember it vividly.",
        "Oh, something wrong? Go ahead and deny it, you wild boar.",
        "Well then. I suppose the Dimitri I once knew died during that slaughter in Duscur, along with my brother.",
        "Hmph. Hurry up and get out of my sight. I don't make a habit of talking to beasts.",
        "You don't look busy. Join me for some training, boar prince.",
        "We don't need to speak to clash swords, do we?",
        "Hmph! I suppose you would recognize its value. I came upon a merchant selling weapons and found this among the rest of the steel.",
        "I'm not giving it to you.",
        "Do you take me for a fool? I'm not letting a brute like you swing it around.",
        "I recall when you were nine years old, you swung a sword so hard you snapped it clean in two.",
        "Heh. So you say, yet House Fraldarius still told that story for years.",
        "How pointless. No use talking about someone who's long dead. Looking at your face is making me angry. I'm going to find a different training partner. Farewell, Your Beastliness.",
        "I have a question for you. Answer quickly before my hand slips and I cut you in half.",
        "Sometimes you have an animal's face, contorted with anger and bloodlust. At other times, a man's, with a friendly smile. Which is your true face?",
        "Hah. So, that's how you justify your atrocities.",
        "\"I will fulfill my duty to the late king.\" My old man used to say that over and over, like a mantra. How nauseating. No one seems to understand. The dead won't acknowledge your loyalty. They don't care. What a load of bunk it is, pretending to serve a corpse. You're serving your own ego.",
        "No, I'm not. The dead are dead, the living are living. You have to respect that boundary. If you keep stringing gravestones around your neck, you'll snap.",
        "Then keep those thoughts to yourself. If you're too weak to do that, abandon your throne. Become a grave keeper.",
        "I'm not immune to emotion, you know. Far from it. I haven't gone a day without questioning why my father and brother had to die, while I survived. I'll bear this pain until the day I die, but I refuse to wallow in it. I have more important things to do than blubber for my whole life.",
        "What are you getting at?",
        "Hmph. Not my intention. I couldn't stand the pathetic look on your face. That's all.",
        "Ahem.",
        "No. Here. I believe this is yours.",
        "Stop asking questions and just take it.",
        "Why are you acting like this?",
        "You're being difficult. Come on, this is yours.",
        "Shut up! Just take the thing.",
        "What? Who's going to—",
        "My sword! How did you—",
        "What an odd girl. But she's certainly caught my attention. I've never seen that technique before. Oh. I still have to give this back to her.",
        "You.",
        "I never said that. Stay right there. You're always running away. You must really find me irritating.",
        "Stop. Do you remember when you came up behind me and knocked the sword from my hands? I need you to teach me that technique.",
        "Maybe so. But I saw you do it. You don't remember? You moved like a flash, and before I knew it—",
        "Yes, evidence. I still have your satchel. See?",
        "You know it's yours.",
        "This is getting nowhere. But, hmm... Maybe I should corner her like last time. Then she'll use the technique without thinking.",
        "Never mind. I'm done here.",
        "That's Bernadetta. Those thugs are pursuing her. What did the weakling expect, running ahead? I can't leave her alone for one second...",
        "Ah! The technique! No. I can't stand by and watch.",
        "You're not hurt, are you?",
        "Shut your mouth and calm down. I should be thanking you.",
        "When you were surrounded, I got to see you use your technique again. I get it now. For just a moment, you flail your limbs like a wild creature. If I could learn to do that, I'd be unstoppable.",
        "I would be even more impressed if you hadn't been screaming the whole time.",
        "Why are you staring at me?",
        "You don't know me.",
        "OK, that's it! Quit making fun of me!",
        "What is it? I'm listening.",
        "Oh, I agree. I don't dislike cats.",
        "No, thank you. Sweet or not, I don't eat candy.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Why are you so concerned with me? More importantly, didn't you used to be shy?",
        "Then why are you following me around?",
        "You're saying I'm a ghost.",
        "Heh. There you are, foolish as ever.",
        "What?",
        "Heh. I'm disappointed. Such a trivial reason. You're pestering me without a hint of fear, just to see me smile. You've really grown up.",
        "Uh... Come on. You were saying something about a book I should read?",
        "Hunh! Hah! Hyah!",
        "What?",
        "What do you want?",
        "I'll pass. I don't like sweets. Also, you're a nuisance. Stay away from me.",
        "Shhh. Shut up.",
        "You are a pest. Fine—do what you will.",
        "Hah! Hyuh! Hunh!",
        "You're distracting me. When I am hungry, I will eat. Alone. Stop squawking at me.",
        "Finally.",
        "You're following me. Stop.",
        "What do you want?",
        "I heard a rumor that you're planning to settle down with a noble.",
        "Interesting? I'm not interesting. What do you mean?",
        "The Empire's nobility, maybe. The Kingdom's nobility is a whole different animal.",
        "Why? I don't answer to them. All that matters is improving my skill. I'll prove my worth on the battlefield. Those people care so much about appearances they can't even see each other. It makes me sick.",
        "Hm.",
        "You. Get over here.",
        "You're always following me around. At least make yourself useful. Let's spar.",
        "I don't joke. Draw your weapon, unless you intend to fight without one.",
        "If you don't attack first, I will.",
        "For someone whose only aspiration is marriage, you're pretty strong.",
        "Perhaps I had you all wrong. I thought you were just a frivolous girl who cared only for men of status. On the contrary, you seem well aware of the realities of the world. I respect that.",
        "I will?",
        "Just this once.",
        "Don't get carried away.",
        "It is.",
        "It is.",
        "It...it is.",
        "None of those. I already told you I don't joke.",
        "You can sing?",
        "Oh, right. I forgot.",
        "You're insincere and loud, is what I think. But you do make a good sparring partner. And a good tea companion.",
        "Anyway. When's the concert?",
        "You just invited me. You can't tell me not to come. That's for me to decide.",
        "I haven't said I'll go.",
        "Fine. I'll go.",
        "Hold a moment, dog.",
        "I don't see anyone else here, do you? You're that boar's lapdog.",
        "Ha, spoken like a good pet. Why do you follow him with such devotion? Do you really think a man like that is worth it?",
        "The punishment of Duscur.",
        "That's what we call \"blind obedience.\" Tell me. Would you give your life for him?",
        "And what if he commanded you to join him in a senseless massacre?",
        "Even a massacre of children, or the elderly, or your own comrades?",
        "Blind obedience. You're right. I did misunderstand. I shouldn't have called you a lapdog. You're a rabid cur. You and the boar prince make quite a team—two crazed animals.",
        "I've said my piece. Scamper back to your master.",
        "Hey, wait.",
        "You defended me in battle. Why?",
        "You are a colossal idiot. One slip-up and you would have died. You think he would've been happy about that?",
        "Then why protect me? I thought you were his mindless weapon, his sword and shield.",
        "He did, but I don't see that that has to do with anything. Are you repaying some kind of debt? I hope you're not going to praise his death. I heard enough of that from my old man.",
        "To hear a rabid dog call me a \"brother in arms\"...",
        "\"Concerned\" is a strong word. Your death would have been unpleasant. That's all.",
        "What's that supposed to mean? I just meant—Never mind! OK, go ahead, protect me. But if you act like a fool and get yourself killed, I'll kill you.",
        "I... You-you know what I meant!",
        "No need. I was just curious who it belonged to.",
        "No. I despise them.",
        "What do you find so interesting?",
        "Ridiculous. Friendship, loyalty, justice. Only fools allow their lives to be ruled by such nonsense. Fools who get themselves killed for nothing, only to be celebrated as heroes in books like this. Writers of these stories are worse than tyrants. They seize control of people's thoughts.",
        "I don't care. Such blind enthusiasm is dangerous. Be more moderate in your passions.",
        "Excuse me?",
        "Disgusting. Stop looking at me like that.",
        "Why is this happening...",
        "I suppose your thoughts are still with Lord Lonato.",
        "Perhaps. Yet knowing someone well does not mean you know how they feel. Whether family or friend. To know someone's sorrow and turn blindly from it... That is the act of a fool. But pursuing your ideals is not foolish.",
        "I said to be moderate in your passions, not to abandon your ideals. It's OK to be who you are.",
        "Ah, I almost forgot. You lent me this.",
        "Actually, I already knew the story. My brother used to read it to me all the time.",
        "I suppose.",
        "Heh. Well, I think you're like the squire in the book. He's only half a knight, but he's bold and gregarious. And he always does his best. Don't stop being that half-knight, OK?",
        "Chat with them by yourself. You're interrupting my training.",
        "Long enough, if you ask me. We only know each other because of our parents' friendship. I didn't have a say in it.",
        "That's enough.",
        "I said, \"That's enough.\"",
        "Look. You've been getting on my nerves for years. I've tried to be patient with you, but I'm tired of holding my tongue. You're reckless in your personal affairs and in battle. And you're always prattling on about women!",
        "You're insatiable. Do you ever stop? Certainly not to practice your sword technique. You always skip training. And you never consider how your actions hurt others...or how you hold them back.",
        "Hmph.",
        "Sylvain. I want to apologize for the other day.",
        "You know...when I called you \"insatiable.\"",
        "No, I suppose not.",
        "And whenever you dragged me into something, Ingrid would find out and start lecturing us.",
        "Well, you're not any different. Good-for-nothing then. Good-for-nothing now.",
        "I was on my way to train and I saw you. That's all.",
        "Better than sitting idle like you.",
        "No.",
        "My training. Good-bye for now.",
        "Sylvain. Eat these.",
        "A girl in town gave them to me, but I don't want them.",
        "You're incorrigible. No. I wanted to thank you for your help in battle. If you hadn't spotted that enemy ambush, I would have been killed.",
        "You never change.",
        "You're always...",
        "Nothing.",
        "Maybe I'll tell you later. Maybe I won't.",
        "OK, just this once. Only because you saved my life.",
        "Sylvain.",
        "You irresponsible fool! Protecting me like that. You're so weak, and yet you always...always...",
        "Stop kidding around. You're not going to die. I won't let you.",
        "Sylvain!",
        "You really are a fool. The biggest in all of Fódlan. I thought something was off. There's no way you could die from such a small cut. You're so reckless and inattentive, I thought this might be divine punishment.",
        "I am grateful. You've been doing this ever since we were children. Constantly fooling around, but then showing up and helping when we really need you. I'll admit, seeing that smile on your face, I almost want to give you a hug. Almost.",
        "Hmph! I won't be repeating it, you half-wit. You're obviously fine, so I'll leave now.",
        "Obviously.",
        "I remember.",
        "I know... I know. But I'm tired of these close calls. You have to stop fooling around. Take your training more seriously. You can die whenever you please, but I'm not going down with you.",
        "Hmph. Then I hope you have a speedy recovery.",
        "'''' Sylvain? Thank you.",
        "Oh. Hm.",
        "Please don't.",
        "Mercedes, what's wrong with you?",
        "You're not my mother. You don't have to bother with all this. I can do without it.",
        "I do?",
        "Sorry to state the obvious, but I'm not your brother. I'm not Emile. Can't you find someone else to bother?",
        "I am me—Felix Hugo Fraldarius. There is no one else. Brother...",
        "Here you are.",
        "You were injured in the last battle. Are you OK?",
        "You really are troublesome.",
        "What are you even doing on the battlefield? You endangered yourself and got hurt. Such a stupid thing to do.",
        "If you intend to carry on being such a fool, you'd best stay near me.",
        "You can, um...",
        "You can keep thinking of me as your little brother. That'd be better than going through this again.",
        "I am fed up with it. I've already spent years filling in for someone who's dead. My older brother inspired love and respect—he was a great knight. He died. Since his death, his memory has followed me around like a shadow.",
        "Hmph. I don't let my personal feelings distract me on the battlefield. Still, do I really remind you of him?",
        "You need to pay attention to your surroundings. You're reckless. Lives are at stake. Including mine, when I have to run over and save your skin.",
        "Whatever.",
        "Do you need something? Let's hear it.",
        "When I said you could be near me, I meant on the battlefield. You're pushing it a little too far. You'd better not start calling me \"Emile.\"",
        "I don't understand. Why are you hanging around me, if not to replace your brother?",
        "What?",
        "Um, no. It's not that.",
        "What a perplexing creature.",
        "I can't think of a reason to refuse your invitation, so I suppose I have to accept.",
        "I hope I'm not interrupting.",
        "I heard enough to know that you're hungry.",
        "You have nice footwork. Get something to eat. I can take over watering the plants.",
        "And you're shouting.",
        "I actually did call out that I was coming in. It's not my fault you didn't hear.",
        "I didn't realize there were songs about bears and swamp beasties. That food song seemed to be close to your heart. Your stomach isn't far from your heart, after all.",
        "Huh. What was that about? I better water these plants. Wouldn't want them to get thirsty, or they might start singing too.",
        "Yes.",
        "Why?",
        "Forget what?",
        "No, thanks.",
        "I can't. It's permanently etched in my memory. A mountain of sweets, as well as steaks and cakes. Stacks of them, apparently. I'm also intrigued by those bear and swamp beastie songs you mentioned. Ah, and I've been to ask about the move that went along with \"crumbs and yums.\" Was that fencing footwork?",
        "Hm?",
        "This isn't about steak. I just—",
        "Huh. I was just trying to be nice. \"Funny ideas about food.\" Even the bullies in her head are ridiculous. I really don't understand that girl.",
        "If you blow up the library, where will we put the books?",
        "I heard singing.",
        "You shouldn't dance up there. You could fall.",
        "A different song? Like what?",
        "Now those sound interesting.",
        "Oh. Sure, no problem. What? You're not going to sing anymore?",
        "Ah, that's too bad. I wanted to hear what happened after the library was blown away.",
        "Huh. That doesn't really explain what happened with the library. Maybe they'll build a new one?",
        "I'm not hiding.",
        "No, I don't.",
        "Because of you.",
        "I want you to sing for me. I hear your voice when I'm asleep, or in battle... It's like...it's like I'm your captive.",
        "I can't help it... Ugh! I don't know what I'm saying. Forget I said anything.",
        "I don't know. Shut up. I'm not blushing.",
        "Uh...",
        "Oh? I'd better go. Bye.",
        "Uh, yes. I do.",
        "I'd like to hear all of them. If you don't mind. Starting with the library song, in full. Sing for me. Please, Annette?",
        "**  Those things are such a waste of time.",
        "Must I?",
        "I was offering my honest opinion.",
        "I have no idea.",
        "That may be an exaggeration. Successful armies must be able to handle unexpected situations. That starts with weapon mastery and creative tactics.",
        "Now you're just massaging my ego.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Hello.",
        "Another silly legend?",
        "What nonsense. I was talking about real-world tactics, not some dumb ethical question.",
        "Stop bothering with all this. You're not meant to be a knight. Go find a husband.",
        "You heard me.",
        "Perhaps not. At least I know not to heedlessly obey orders. I know not to romanticize blind obedience. My brother taught me to think for myself.",
        "You're right. Forget it.",
        "You're wounded, and you're going too slowly. I couldn't stand to watch.",
        "I could have handled the situation alone. That enemy wasn't much of a threat.",
        "That's why you were protecting me, huh? What a fool you are.",
        "You've been reading that garbage again?",
        "That's just the editor's opinion.",
        "Hmph! You know nothing.",
        "My own beliefs.",
        "You don't understand.",
        "OK, fine, you do understand. My point is, don't let this happen again. If you died, I'd be...annoyed.",
        "You're insufferable.",
        "Lysithea. You look mortified.",
        "I was, yes.",
        "Did you say something?",
        "What's this for?",
        "I'm not sure what to be silent about.",
        "Adults eat cake.",
        "No. I don't like sweets.",
        "I just don't like sweets, that's all.",
        "What was her problem? And what am I supposed to do with this cake?",
        "I don't understand you.",
        "Trust me, I didn't mean to interrupt.",
        "I don't know. I didn't eat it. I gave it to some kid.",
        "We've been over this. I don't like sweets.",
        "Everyone has their own tastes.",
        "I'm not sure why you're so fixated on this.",
        "I don't know. I just don't like it.",
        "No. I already told you, I don't want it.",
        "Not light enough, I'd bet. If I eat this, will you stop bothering me?",
        "Let's get this over with.",
        "You don't change. Still prattling on about it.",
        "Uh... It was edible.",
        "It was satisfying and lightweight. I imagine it would be quite useful as a battlefield provision.",
        "You're upset and I don't understand why. I'm complimenting the cake. You cured my dislike of sweets. For that I thank you.",
        "Yes. Got any cakes on you?",
        "That's not what I meant. If you've baked a cake, however, I wouldn't object to eating a slice.",
        "OK.",
        "Mmm.",
        "Mmm.",
        "Mmm? OK. That does sound nice.",
        "If you don't have any business here, go away. You're bothering me.",
        "What do you want?",
        "Hmph. Spying on people, is that a hobby of yours? I hope you got your fill.",
        "You think you can beat me?",
        "Jeralt, yes.",
        "I heard he was your teacher. Perhaps we should test you—see how much of your training sank in.",
        "OK. I'll give you a chance.",
        "I'll let you know. In the meantime, practice. I won't go easy on you.",
        "This will be fun.",
        "How long did you expect me to stand here?",
        "I can't help having a busy schedule. Plus, I thought you could use the extra time to prepare.",
        "Hmph. You were the one who kept me waiting. Let's begin.",
        "Hurry up.",
        "Let's see what you— Huh?! Aaaaargh! A pit trap?",
        "Coward!",
        "I'll admit, I wasn't expecting that.",
        "Yes. I underestimated you. I suppose your lateness was a ploy to distract me.",
        "His technique worked, and you won. What else is there to say? Winning is all that matters. You drew my attention to a major vulnerability. I'll need to be wary of traps. Thank you, Leonie.",
        "The loser must pay tribute, I suppose. Yes, I'll help you train.",
        "And that's how it's done.",
        "Yes. You're a quick learner, Leonie, and quite a good teacher as well.",
        "I agree. A warrior can't stick too closely to predefined tactics. That's quite shrewd. You're impressive for a girl.",
        "I suppose that's true.",
        "I still have much to learn. Not only about swordplay, but also about thinking on my feet. I hope to learn more from you, Leonie.",
        "We're what?",
        "Hm. Partners. That's not bad.",
        "Likewise...partner.",
        "May I help you, Seteth?",
        "Do you have need of my sword?",
        "\"Distance\"? I don't follow.",
        "Hmph. Keeping a close eye on me. They don't share my values. That's all.",
        "You seem displeased. I suppose you're going to tell me, \"To defeat your enemies, you must have dependable allies.\"",
        "You sound like my father. You're saying it's in my own interest to make friends?",
        "I wouldn't have guessed that. There are so many devout believers.",
        "I'll consider your advice, but I'm not usually one to change my mind.",
        "Spying on me again, I see.",
        "Hmph. You really have been watching me closely. You're correct. I don't understand why they revere knighthood. I won't be friends with anyone who believe in that nonsense.",
        "My brother was doing his job. My father is the real problem. When my brother's armor was brought back to the castle, do you know what he said? \"He died like a true knight.\" Chivalry begets the worship and glorification of death. Am I alone in finding that grotesque? I suppose you'll excommunicate me for blaspheming like this.",
        "In that case, I'd like you to formally pardon me for not having friends.",
        "Seteth. Can I ask one thing? Why are you going out of your way to tell me this? Why bother with me at all?",
        "I see. You've gone to so much trouble, I may have to start making an effort as well.",
        "Hunh! Hya!",
        "Why are you here? You're interrupting.",
        "Probably.",
        "You want me to cut this firewood?",
        "Sounds like a chore.",
        "What? I am more than capable.",
        "Doing them one by one is tedious. Just throw them all at once.",
        "I know.",
        "Why did I agree to this?",
        "Flayn. What's that you're hiding?",
        "No. I'm not doing that again. I've got better uses for my sword than chopping up fruit and firewood.",
        "Chopping up my enemies.",
        "That's not how I'd put it, but a blade's purpose is to kill. To chop wood, use an axe. To chop food, use a knife. It's simple.",
        "What a noble sentiment. But without a blade to cut down your enemies, you cannot win. Those who are weak lose everything, and they die. Those who are strong win, and live on. I understand why you balk at bloodshed, but you must know that it has a purpose.",
        "A purpose. Let's just leave it at that. I'm not in the mood to debate you. I'll continue to wield my sword. And, if necessary, cut down my enemies.",
        "You. What is it now?",
        "This again... Yes, that's what I said. You still have a problem with that?",
        "Oh. OK. Then I'll get back to my training.",
        "To end the war, you'd have to kill more people.",
        "That's pure fantasy. But if it came to pass, there would be no place for me. What would I do? I was raised to swing a sword. It's all I know. In a world without strife, warriors like me would be lost souls. It's tragic in a way. We fight to bring peace and then, if we achieve it, we lose our purpose.",
        "What a generous offer.",
        "Hm. I never thought about it, but maybe there is a path for me in peacetime. I'm intrigued. I might even like to realize this fantasy of yours."

        "Why do you look so surprised? Of course, it is not a valid duel unless both parties are willing. Now that you have refused outright, I must come up with some other way of getting that which I seek.",
        "Only that I will find some other way of showing everyone that I am superior to you. Huh. I will write a handbill listing your accomplishments, alongside my own, more impressive accomplishments. Copyists will produce thousands of these pamphlets and distribute them far and wide. Then everyone will know about my—",
        "Edelgard, hello. What do you think of this horse? An equine marvel, no? Look how intelligent he is! You can see it in his face. Certainly much smarter than your horse.",
        "Behold, Edelgard! Do you see this blood-red bloom? This is much more impressive than the pale little sprigs you have there. And, as I am sure you know, redness symbolizes courage and strength.",
        "What are you complaining about? You told me not to publish my pamphlet, and I complied.",
        "Ah, so you will fight me after all? Wonderful! To battle, then!",
        "All right, Edelgard. Have at me.",
        "Argh... It only took you one blow... How?!",
        "Fastest and strongest? You're just flattering me. I have been defeated. Utterly. I cannot believe I was foolish enough to challenge such a plainly superior opponent.",
        "I do not think talent is what separates us so much as readiness. I had not the faintest idea of what to expect from a real duel. I was playing, but you were not. That such an ill-prepared student would think to challenge you... It is laughable.",
        "Ah! The smell, the texture, the smooth finish. This region's tea is the finest in the world.",
        "What is that supposed to mean?! Perhaps you expected me to hold a grudge against you after our duel. In fact, I have moved on.",
        "I took it hard at the time, I will confess. I always thought that I equaled you in skill, or even surpassed you. But you showed me that I do not come close to matching your talents. Yet a true noble does not give up in the face of defeat. I will continue my training, and one day I will be an elite warrior. That is the path I must take, as a noble and a man of honor.",
        "Yes. One day, I will surpass your abilities, and I will defeat you in combat.",
        "Hm. I have something I would like to say to you too. Certainly, we must recognize the commonfolk who strive for greatness and attain it. But for those of us born into nobility, things are more complicated. From birth, nobles must excel. If we do not, we will be forced out of our houses. This environment breeds superior individuals, and they, in turn, recreate the rigorous environment for their own children. Without that cycle, there would be no political elite guiding the world towards prosperity.",
        "I would not go so far as to say your way is \"wrong.\" Just that another way might be better. If you insist upon undoing the nobility, then we must build something in its place. We can provide free education for all, and then select the highest-performing students for more intensive training and tutoring. I truly believe that people are products of their environment.",
        "Yes, exactly! Finally, Edelgard, you appreciate how important I am to your cause!",
        "Edelgard... I have to tell you something. I think now is the right time. Do you know what my ancestor Derick von Aegir said after your ancestor defeated him? He said, \"You are an Imperial beauty! Please accept me as your husb—\"",
        "Hm. With this idea, I may be able to get the one-up on Edelgard.",
        "Hubert! I wish you would not sneak up on me like that.",
        "Sedition? Absurd. This is an important project.",
        "Anything is better than being a noble like you. Every time you open your mouth it's \"Lady Edelgard this\" or \"Lady Edelgard that.\" Do you ever think for yourself? You follow her around like a pet. You spend all of your time fretting over her, and yet you never truly express an opinion of your own. Before you reprimand me, take a moment to consider your own failings.",
        "Yes, I understand that. But my duty is to guide her, to give frank advice when she is on the wrong course of action. That is what I strive to do, always. Thus my devotion to surpass Edelgard, so that if she needs guidance, I will be prepared for it. If you think it is tiresome to have a mind of your own, you will never be much of an advisor.",
        "I have nothing more to say to you. Get out of here.",
        "Hubert, that letter. Is that what I think it was?",
        "But Edelgard—",
        "I cannot believe it! You disobeyed a direct order? I thought you were her loyal aide.",
        "You are not supposed to do it in secret! When you disagree with your leader, you must voice your concerns directly. Otherwise, what is the point?",
        "You are sorely misguided! When I believe Edelgard is making a mistake, I tell her as much. Through discussing the matter, I sometimes find that I was mistaken. To skip that process, to make a decision that is not yours to make...",
        "Excuse me?!",
        "Ugh, I have had enough of your grousing. To think, I started to believe you were a useful aide.",
        "Drink tea, you say, but that does not smell like tea. The aroma... Would that be coffee by any chance? Imported from Dagda, I believe. I do not care for it myself.",
        "Excuse me?",
        "I... What?",
        "Hubert... Are you all right? Do you have a cold? Or the plague? Am I hearing a deathbed confession?",
        "Dramatic, you say?",
        "So because you assess people without emotion, you're totally confident in your appraisals. It seems I was wrong about you.",
        "Please do not compliment me again though. I find it quite unsettling. It is like hearing a snake sing an aria. At least put it in a letter next time.",
        "Your nose is as sharp as ever, Hubert. Yes, it is a bag of fresh coffee beans.",
        "My stance has not changed. Drab, bitter, with a muddy texture. If I have even a sip, my hands start to tremble.",
        "Well, you see— Wait a moment. What is that? Is that an imported tea from the east?",
        "Flaunting my favorite drink, right in front of me! And you do not even drink tea. Fiendish. It is for Edelgard, I assume?",
        "Well, I...",
        "A gift, yes. For you.",
        "Yes, that is what I said. A noble does not go back on his word. Just take it.",
        "Why?",
        "For me? Are you certain? I would hate to deprive the intended recipient of such a fine tea.",
        "Oh, in that case, thank— What? You were planning to give this to me all along?",
        "Really? I... Hahaha!",
        "Only one thing to do. We must take a tea break.",
        "Of course. I will make you some coffee.",
        "Linhardt. Lost in thought, I see. Unacceptable! Are you not aware that a noble's duty is to be ever vigilant?",
        "Well, I was just passing by, and I thought I could give you a little advice. You always seem to be napping. Why not spend your free time doing something productive?",
        "Hmph. Some training will remedy that. Let us work on that today. I will train you myself! Arise, Linhardt! The righteous path of the noble lies before you!",
        "Yes, I am. is there something wrong with that?",
        "I consider it my mission to serve as a guide and a model for other members of the nobility.",
        "Oh, you are far too kind... Although I do work hard each day to achieve all of which you speak.",
        "Indeed! I went for a ride earlier today.",
        "Hm? Where are you going?",
        "\"Noble among nobles\"? Seems a bit much. Did he say \"get some sleep\"? Hey, wait!",
        "Linhardt. There you are.",
        "''' '''You have been utilizing clever tricks to give me the slip. But not today. Prepare yourself! \"A noble cannot escape from his duty.\" Hold these words in your heart.",
        "Finally, a little enthusiasm. You are bravely stepping upon the path of nobility. Let us begin!",
        "Wait! I will not allow you to get away!",
        "Just admit defeat...",
        "Well, maybe just for a moment... I could use a rest myself. I am surprised you could run that far. I had assumed that all that lounging around would have dulled your constitution. But I had a difficult time keeping up.",
        "It does, does it not? Well, how about we say that thrilling chase was your training for the day? If you will excuse me, I am going to run even more, so I can catch you next time!",
        "Haha, and what is wrong with that?",
        "Impressive, Caspar. Well done.",
        "I saw it from start to finish. Both parties were at fault, disturbing the peace. Then you stepped in and corrected their behavior. You are setting a good example. I am proud to call you my fellow noble.",
        "Excuse me, \"nothing\"? Resolving conflicts among commonfolk is a duty of the nobles. Is that not what you were doing?",
        "Ah. You were acting on impulse. You might be better served following moral convictions rather than instincts. Take me, for example. I always bear in mind that I am a noble and behave accordingly. The fortunate help the unfortunate. That is my guiding principle.",
        "Hmph. A difference of opinion, you might say. Very well then. Believe what you will. I will not expend energy trying to change your mind.",
        "Caspar. I have been waiting.",
        "I am going to give you a lesson on the righteous path of the noble.",
        "That remains to be seen. I heard you stopped a robbery in town the other day. Some despicable thief who was robbing an elderly shopkeeper. Rumor has it you didn't wreak as much havoc as usual.",
        "How, uh, magnanimous of you.",
        "Ah, so you walloped the scoundrel. That does sound like you. I am finding this story more plausible. Nevertheless, I think—",
        "My turn, eh? Let's hear this story, then.",
        "Stop, stop. I know what you are getting at, but you have the wrong idea.",
        "I had been browsing for weapons at a run-down stall. Suddenly, a man seized the stall's owner and started dragging him away! Someone with a less generous spirit might say the peddler had it coming. His wares were quite inferior, after all. But without a moment's hesitation, I leapt to his aid and soundly defeated the goon!",
        "It was nothing, really. Anyway, the old shopkeeper let me in on the details. He said that he was a novice trader, tricked by a noble into selling low-quality goods. That ruse was about to come to light. So the noble had sent a mercenary to keep the shopkeeper silent.",
        "Well, I won't deny it. I forgot my rank for a moment and let my instincts take over.",
        "And your, uh, gentle approach to handling that robbery... That sounds like something I might do. You were not overcome by your impulses. You kept a cool head. For the most part.",
        "Partners in justice, eh? Well now. That I can agree to.",
        "Bernadetta, I have something to discuss with you.",
        "No need to be defensive. I am not angry.",
        "You did not do anything wrong! Please listen. Look, just breathe, will you?",
        "I see that you are struggling. Please calm down.",
        "I just wanted to discuss how you are always hiding in your room. It seems like something must be troubling you, for you to shut yourself away like that. If something is the matter, maybe I can help. But you need to tell me what it is first.",
        "Do you not realize that life is passing you by? Have you no desire to venture beyond this reclusive lifestyle? There is a whole world waiting for you out there. The social life of a noble is actually rather—",
        "Bernadetta, this is unhealthy behavior. I beg you to take my hand. Otherwise, I will have to pick you up and carry you, and neither of us—",
        "Aaagh!",
        "Ah, ouch... I sprained my wrist...",
        "I do not wish to hurt you. Actually, I—",
        "Maybe I should just come back later...",
        "Bernadetta. If you have a moment, I would like to discuss what happened before.",
        "I am not here to hurt you! You need not even open the door. Just listen to me.",
        "Thank you. I would like to apologize for sticking my nose into your business the way I did. I thought you might be unhappy all cooped up in there, and that maybe I could help. But I've had time to reflect on what you said, and I realize I was mistaken.",
        "I see that. I suppose that is what I am trying to say. I should not have pushed you to do something that you did not wish to do. And for me to frighten you like that... That was unbecoming conduct for a noble.",
        "Frankly, I am embarrassed by my behavior. I disgraced myself. As for my injury, you need not feel guilty or afraid. The sprain was a result of my own thoughtlessness, not anything you did. I have always strived to be a good person...but I suppose all that striving was for nothing. I have failed in my duty as a noble.",
        "Yes, Bernadetta?",
        "Really, it is fine. It healed quickly.",
        "I am not so sure.",
        "Yes. Keep working at it. You are already much more outgoing than you used to be.",
        "What a graceful end to the conversation.",
        "Ah, even with the fires of war raging all around use, tea never fails to soothe the soul. Do you not agree, Bernadetta?",
        "Excellent! Oh, that reminds me...",
        "A long time ago, my parents were in talks to arrange my marriage with a certain young lady. She never set foot outside of her room, and she made little dolls to curse her perceived enemies. Such were the rumors. Frightened, I dissuaded my parents from going through with their plans.",
        "That girl was you, Bernadetta. A daughter of House Varley.",
        "You are a skilled embroiderer, no? I guess I was wrong. You were not making dolls.",
        "Ah, hmm... Maybe I should not have brought this up.",
        "Aha, yes. Adorable. Anyway, If I had actually known you, I would have accepted the proposal.",
        "No. I just mean, now that I have gotten to know you, I would have been happy to...",
        "Why are you getting so worked up? That was all a long time ago, now.",
        "Yes, Now we are soldiers fighting together in the same great conflict, right? And my parents are gone, so any agreements they might have cooked up would be completely invalid.",
        "Just think. If we had been married, we would not have been able to build such a deep friendship.",
        "So, all in all, I am glad I refused to marry that doll-cursing princess.",
        "Haha! Sorry, sorry. I am just glad to have met you at the monastery. I had better take my leave. We should have tea together again sometime soon!",
        "Ah, Dorothea! The dining hall seems so much brighter with you here.",
        "Flattery? No, I was not... there you go with that attitude again. Why do you reserve such cold treatment for me, and me alone? Do you hate me, Dorothea? Or have you some other reason to avoid my company?",
        "Huh. I was right. Might I ask why you find me so despicable? I can scarcely guess.",
        "That will not do. I do not think you would hate a person for no reason.",
        "Very well. I cannot walk away from a challenge. I have no choice but to chance a guess. You are always making fun, calling me a \"big shot\" and so forth. Perhaps you think all nobles are... no, it could not be that simple.",
        "Please. Will you not give me a clue?",
        "A bee? I haven't the slightest... perhaps because I am such a diligent worker?",
        "Ah, you have arrived at just the right time. Care for one of these handmade treats?",
        "Oh, Dorothea! I am hardly an expert.",
        "Well, it is the first time I have tried my hand at it. Honestly, there were several unsuccessful attempts preceding this batch. I made these pastries to solve that riddle you gave me. The reason you despise me.",
        "You said I was like a bee. The bee is a dutiful worker, just as I am. But the bee inherits a capacious home, with a wealth of honey. Similarly, I inherited my fortune. I did not receive it as a reward for my labor. I surmised that perhaps you'd feel differently about me if I earned something all on my own. That was my plan. To emulate transformation from desperate pauper to successful songstress.",
        "No. I made these! I obtained all the ingredients on my own, without anyone's help.",
        "Yes. To earn the flour, I worked in the fields. To earn the sugar, I carried a merchant's wares.",
        "Naturally! I took on some extra chores in exchange for use of the kitchen at night.",
        "I burned myself a little while I was baking. Nothing to worry about.",
        "Wait! Dorothea! You have yet to try my treats...",
        "There you go again. Noble this, noble that. Though you did say it with less disdain than usual.",
        "You have reconsidered me? Finally! Just as I had hoped, we are becoming friends. Now then, I propose that we—",
        "So, I am still a bee. A completely mystified bee...",
        "Ah, Dorothea. I am surprised to find you here. I did not think you were all that religious.",
        "You must be quite brave to speak so coarsely in this hallowed place. But what do you mean...about suffering as a child?",
        "I see. I remember seeing street children around the city...",
        "So, that is why you despise the nobility. But why do you think I am the same as them? Do you really believe that is the kind of man I am? You think I would ever treat people differently based on appearances? There is nothing noble about that!",
        "Me?! No... It could not have been...",
        "So, it was you then, singing that song... Dorothea, please listen. This is a misunderstanding. When I saw you... I could not take my eyes off you. I was hypnotized. Your beautiful voice, your elegant face...droplets of water on your skin that glittered in the sun. I thought you were a water nymph.",
        "No, it is true. I was only a child. The vision overwhelmed me. That is why I ran. I plucked up the courage to return, but no one was there. I thought perhaps it was a dream...",
        "Of course. I am glad we had this conversation. You know, I do not mind you thinking of me as a bee. Life as a simple drone, circling a queen... It actually sounds quite wonderful.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Mm hmm...",
        "Diplomacy has an effect upon weapons development. Yes... That makes sense. Oh! Petra! How long have you been there?",
        "Forgive me. I was fully absorbed in my reading. I see you have been reading as well. Anything interesting?",
        "A history book! What a keen student you are. And it's about House Hresvelg. Certainly a stimulating topic.",
        "Oh, this? This relates to a little hobby of mine— the regional history of weapons development in Fódlan. Militaries have to adapt their weapons according to terrain and climate, and they have to keep up with technologies in other regions. It's very interesting.",
        "Oh, does that excite your curiosity too? Perhaps you would care to read more about it, then. This is just one of 18 volumes. And our library has the entire collection!",
        "Oh! It is not like you to forget something. I suppose I ought to be going, then.",
        "Taking care of some weapon maintenance, Petra? You seem completely absorbed.",
        "I cannot argue with that. That weapon there... is it from Brigid?",
        "Fascinating! I have read about the weapons of Dagda, but this is my first time seeing one in person.",
        "Ah, so Dagda to the west had a big influence on the Brigid archipelago. I am fascinated by foreign fighting techniques. Would you consider teaching me sometime?",
        "Yes, a practical demonstration! I would be quite grateful.",
        "Perhaps we should stop there...",
        "Yes, now I have experienced it firsthand. I used to look down on foreign fighting styles, but I was clearly remiss. The footwork, the nimble way you shift your weight, is extraordinary. I will have to remember those moves for the next time I am in battle. Clearly, you have honed your skills through practice. Your fist felt as sharp as a spear.",
        "When the alliance of Brigid and Dagda encroached on the Empire they were always driven back. But perhaps the Empire's victory was due to geographic advantage or divine intervention rather than military superiority. Having met you, that is what I think. I cannot help but feel a little disgraced. I help foreign fighting styles in such low regard without ever seeing them for myself.",
        "Yes, by working together we can make progress. And both sides need to look ahead, to the future.",
        "Huh? Ah, Petra. Is there something I can help you with?",
        "Lonely, in wartime? Hardly. I am too busy trying to survive to feel lonely. But once we have survived, what will you do with yourself, Petra? Return to your home?",
        "Live in Fódlan? Do you not want to go back to your homeland?",
        "New family? I am glad to hear you feel that way about us, Petra. In that case, we will have to make sure that none of us die. We do not want to lose anyone in the family.",
        "Hah, do not worry. I do not intend to die. I have some things to do when the war is over.",
        "Yes. You and I can be the link between Fódlan and Brigid.",
        "OK, I have to confess, I fibbed a little... About not being lonely. When this war ends, I will be quite lonely indeed... if you go back to Brigid.",
        "I have just made a decision. I will work as an ambassador, improving relations between our people. Whether you are in Brigid or Fódlan, I will be there too. Then both places can move forward together, in eternal friendship... We ought to join forces and make that a reality. Do you not agree?",
        "You can count on me. We will keep at it, and one day...",
        "Oh, Mercedes. This is unexpected.",
        "I did. I quite like the atmosphere in the cathedral. It is holy and solemn. Perfectly suited to a noble, wouldn't you say?",
        "You guess so? I think the matter is rather clear-cut. It is incumbent upon nobles that we pray regularly to the goddess.",
        "These days many nobles scarcely, if ever, pray. Look around! You and I are alone in this cathedral. It is really quite a shame.",
        "I am afraid the nobility seems to be losing its way. When you pray, you are usually alone, right?",
        "Precisely. Where are the others? Of course, you cannot force people to worship. That is out of the question. Nobles must determine for themselves what they will believe and how they will pray. A religion foisted on you without your say is not much of a religion at all. Do you not agree?",
        "On the other hand, we cannot stand idly by while...",
        "All in all, one has to conclude... Mercedes? Where did she go? I must have inspired her to go out and revive the faith! Perhaps I should do the same. I cannot let her show me up...",
        "That is quite enough! You would dare threaten a woman? I will not permit such ungentlemanly conduct.",
        "Behind me, milady! I will protect you!",
        "Keep your distance, gutless knave! I just cleaned my sword, and if I maim you I will have to clean it again. Neither of us wants that, so I suggest you leave at once.",
        "Well, that was taken care of. Are you hurt, Mercedes?",
        "Ah, I'm glad! I do not abide uncouth behavior. Stopping it is my duty as a noble!",
        "You know, stepping in to prevent extortion, that was quite brave of you.",
        "No need to be humble. Helping the weak is precisely what a virtuous noble does.",
        "What do you mean by that?",
        "Your past. Hm. You were originally the daughter of House Bartels, a minor noble family, I heard. You abandoned your title, and now you live as a commoner. Is there more to the story? Pray tell.",
        "The man who exploited you so he could join the nobility. Yes, I understand. But I must confess, that part of the story confuses me. There is nothing to gain from having a noble title.",
        "What's so funny?",
        "Oh, well... That's not quite what I meant. Using someone else to obtain high status, with no effort and no accomplishment...Certainly, you can obtain a title like that, but it hardly makes you a noble.",
        "By the same token, although you are legally a commoner, in your heart you are a proud and virtuous noble! That is what I think, at any rate.",
        "Mercedes, finally! There you are.",
        "I just wanted to show you something.",
        "Yes. These are financial records that I recovered from your adoptive father. They prove that when he adopted you, large sums of money changed hands.",
        "I stealthily made my way into Fhirdiad and looked around his estate. It was easy. That kind of thing is no trouble for an intrepid young noble such as myself.",
        "No, I did it for my benefit. I could not help myself. With these documents, we can show everyone what a scoundrel your adoptive father really is. His noble aspirations will be crushed. The lord of the region will probably rescind his adoption contract. In other words, you will be free. Here, take them. Do with them what you will.",
        "Yes. Of course. You will be free to decide your own path in life and go wherever your heart leads you.",
        "Why? Is that not what you want?",
        "You baffle me. Do you not wish to be free?",
        "I cannot argue with that. Fine, then. I will hold on to the documents.",
        "Of course, Mercedes. The smile on your face is well worth the effort.",
        "Not many can appreciate it, let alone recognize it. I am impressed.",
        "By all means! Allow me to pour.",
        "Such a precise, poetic description. But please, drink up. No need to stand on ceremony.",
        "You are clearly quite passionate about tea. And more than just passionate... You know what it takes to brew a fine cup. To say nothing of your flawless etiquette and sterling attentiveness!",
        "Ah, marvelously put, Lorenz. I can tell you have given much thought to this subject. And if I may, I have always considered you to be the very model of noble comportment.",
        "I wholeheartedly concur. Before we part ways, I would like to offer you some of these leaves.",
        "That sounds exquisite. I look forward to it.",
        "I suspect I know what you are referring to. A certain noble who caused a stir at one of the local taverns, correct? For someone of status to make such a scene! What a disgrace.",
        "Oh, ah, that is not quite what I meant. I do not object to a noble patronizing their local establishments. In fact, I would say such excursions have value.",
        "That is wonderfully insightful, Lorenz, albeit not what I had in mind. What I meant was this—we can benefit from crossing the threshold and learning more about regular folk. We scarcely understand the reality of their lives. In turn, they do not know about us. I have heard that some believe we have horns growing from our heads. It is an embarrassing, and potentially perilous, state of affairs.",
        "We all need a laugh now and then. As a man of status, I feel it is my calling to right the world's wrongs. But there is only so much I can do alone. Working in tandem, though, you and I could make tremendous accomplishments.",
        "Yes, precisely! Together, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish. By the way Lorenz... Do you have a tail?",
        "Ah, Marianne. Praying to the goddess?",
        "Excellent! So persistent in your devotion. I quite admire that about you.",
        "No need for false modesty. I hardly know anyone with more piety.",
        "Wait a moment!",
        "I have a suggestion. I have been meaning to tell you about it for a while. Have you ever considered projecting more confidence? Your every word is laden with pessimism and devoid of enthusiasm. To gain the trust of commoners, you must appear self-assured at all times.",
        "But you are the only daughter of the esteemed Margrave Edmund! Regardless of what you hope for, you must concede that you have inherited certain responsibilities, by virtue of your birth.",
        "One would think she does not wish to be a noble...",
        "Marianne, do you have a moment?",
        "I have been thinking about what you said.",
        "You misunderstand. It is not that you upset me. Honestly, you mystify me. You are a noble, and yet you do not wish to be one. Is that not so? I did not expect to hear that from the daughter of Margrave Edmund.",
        "But still, you come from a noble lineage, do you not?",
        "Minor though it may be, you were born into a noble family. Which means you are a noble too. We did not choose to become nobles. We were born into the nobility.",
        "Marianne! I—",
        "I... I see. I will not pretend to understand. But you should try to calm down a bit. Certainly, things did not turn out the way you had hoped. But the conditions are such that—",
        "There will be no convincing you. Very well. I will go.",
        "Marianne. Are you not going to pray?",
        "I just wanted to apologize.",
        "Last time we spoke, I did not quite finish saying what I wanted to say. You say I did nothing wrong, so perhaps you will hear me out this time?",
        "Rather than mourning the way things are, is it not better to accept reality and move forward from there?",
        "Precisely. You curse your heritage and reject your present situation. That makes you gloomy, even despairing. As long as you are held back by that way of thinking, nothing is ever going to change.",
        "I do. Come what may, I will never falter.",
        "Well, each person is born with a purpose. We must fulfill that purpose, no matter our circumstances. It imbues our lives with meaning and direction. That is what I believe, anyway. Everyone has something they are meant to accomplish. That is true for nobles, commoners, even bandits.",
        "Yes! Of course.",
        "Is that so? How wonderful! I will pray that you find the answers you seek.",
        "Marianne, may I join you?",
        "Hmm...",
        "I am sorry, but, uh... You seem very different. Compared to how you were before.",
        "Right there! You are smiling. I do not think I have ever seen you smile.",
        "I do not mean to embarrass you! I am just saying, you seem to have truly changed.",
        "I am so glad to hear you say that, Marianne. I wonder, did you find a purpose for yourself?",
        "It sounds to me like you have already found your answer.",
        "Making people happy. If you ask me, that is a truly worthwhile purpose.",
        "Yes, what about it?",
        "Oh! It is delicious! The flavor and the texture are superb. So you are certainly making me happy!",
        "I hope you will learn to like yourself. For what it is worth, I like you.",
        "Maybe, if you have the time, you can cook something for me again? For me alone, I mean.",
        "Hilda! Do you need something?",
        "I apologize, but I must graciously decline.",
        "I can proffer a guess. Instead of relying on others, why not try doing something on your own? Nobles should not be lazy or idle. We should accomplish our goals through earnest effort.",
        "It was nothing! Anyone could have done the same.",
        "I do not believe that to be true.",
        "What could be difficult about such a task? You simply line them up and count them.",
        "Granted, there might be some creative approaches to completing the task...",
        "Hm. I can point you in the right direction. To start, divide them up by size.",
        "Now, put similar items together. That makes it easier to get a handle on the numbers.",
        "Now that you have arranged everything you can begin counting. See how easy it is?",
        "It was nothing! I... Oh. I suppose I ended up doing her work after all.",
        "Hilda! There you are.",
        "I do not desire your gratitude. I have a bone to pick with you. At the library, you pawned your job off on me!",
        "Ah, well... Hey, wait a moment! Your charms won't work this time. You were just using me.",
        "With a steady pace, you would have finished by twilight at the latest.",
        "You're quite a defeatist, Hilda. I... H-hold a moment. Did you just say you cannot make tea?",
        "Trust me, it is not difficult. You just need to be cautious as you are pouring. I can teach you.",
        "This is a crucial skill for nobles, Hilda. If nothing else, you must learn the art of tea brewing.",
        "Look here. You bring the water to a boil, and you put the leaves in here... All right, that should be enough time steeping. Now we can drain the water, pour the tea, and enjoy.",
        "You may have to steep it for more time or less, depending on the leaves. From now on, you can—",
        "She...she fooled me again! That was the last time, I swear it.",
        "Stay back, Hilda! I will no longer entertain your clever little requests. Your wiles will not work this time!",
        "I am sorry to have offended you, but delightful as it sounds, I will not be brewing any tea at present. Besides, I taught you how to do it before. You should be able to do it on your own, so why don't you?",
        "And why not?",
        "Hm. You seem to know an awful lot about tea, for someone who cannot even pour it.",
        "I was just making tea in the traditional fashion.",
        "Well... When serving another, one must put in a little bit of love. But I must say, you surprise me. Not many are so attentive to the finer points of tea. I made quite the impression on you! Perhaps I ought to pour you another cup.",
        "I shall find us a suitable brew. Wait here a moment.",
        "I have some tea. You are welcome to drink some.",
        "I found it. Here it is.",
        "I returned your book a little while ago.",
        "I have lots of practice fielding your requests. All I need to do is think for a bit, and I know what you need. I can practically read your mind.",
        "Hmm... You want a snack.",
        "I suppose that is inevitable. I am rather fond of you as well. I find your laziness endearing.",
        "I admire you, Hilda.",
        "I said, I admire you. You are gifted and accomplished. I used to underestimate you.",
        "You feign sloth to obscure the considerable breadth and depth of your talents. Such delicate discretion, such noble prudence! If only I could emulate it.",
        "I appreciate that. Shall we go?",
        "I thought you wanted some tea! The dining hall is the place for that.",
        "Hngh! You have met your match, rust! Ach... So stubborn.",
        "Ah, Flayn, hello! Are you referring to the smell of this oil?",
        "I am simply doing some armor maintenance. A little oil keeps the rust at bay, ensuring that the armor moves smoothly, without any hitches.",
        "I would not cook in the training area. Are you hungry by chance?",
        "I doubt that amidst actual fighting, the smell would still make you hungry. We are always dancing with death on the battlefield. When your focus wavers, your life is forfeit.",
        "In that case, I will accompany you to the dining hall. I will be finished in a couple of minutes...",
        "Well, that was quick. Hmm... I will admit, now that I she has mentioned it, it is a rather appetizing smell.",
        "Good day to you too! That is right. I have been overusing it a bit lately. Now, allow me to wager a guess. Are you feeling hungry, as usual?",
        "Of course not. Please, feel free to observe.",
        "Flayn! Careful!",
        "Flayn! Are you all right? Did you injure yourself?",
        "That could have been serious! Please forgive me. I should have warned you first. This is a new type of gauntlet with a spring-loaded blade over the knuckles. The mechanism is rather easily triggered. How foolish of me not to warn you...",
        "Ah, yes. You were in danger and my instincts simply took hold. I hope you will forgive my rashness.",
        "Did it hurt? I am so sorry, Flayn. I did not mean to cause you any discomfort.",
        "Such a delicate creature. And that sweet demeanor... Agh! Snap out of it, Ferdinand!",
        "Flayn, I hope you will allow me to apologize.",
        "Last time, when I was working on my armor, you could have been gravely injured. You have been avoiding me ever since, so I want to reiterate how very sorry I am.",
        "So, you are not avoiding me?",
        "Oh, I see. Well... I do train quite often. On the battlefield, it is perfectly common to lift up a wounded comrade. It has nothing to do with your gender. In the heat of the moment, I pay no attention to such things! That is, uh, how I would explain it.",
        "Well, I would not put it like that. Usually when I embrace people, it is in the context of battle.",
        "Huh? Why?",
        "Uh... Oh! I see what is going on here. I had forgotten how charmingly ethereal you can be... Very well. As per your request, I shall embrace you again.",
        "Why, of course! Easily done. Although, perhaps we shouldn't tell Seteth...",
        "My princess is lovely, my princess is fair, She sings like sweet cicadas in midsummer's air—",
        "Oh! Good point. I will revise... My princess is lovely, my princess is fair, She sings like a swallow in midsummer's air—",
        "No! Wh-what I meant was, ah, hm...",
        "I would not dream of stopping now. This is my golden opportunity!",
        "We are finally alone. Just the two of us.",
        "You see, Manuela, I have long admired you.",
        "I saw you perform countless times while you were with the opera company.",
        "The figure you cut, that heartbreaking voice... I was mesmerized. That is why I am tongue-tied. I am nervous about speaking to you alone, after idolizing you for so long.",
        "Yes! Uh, ahem... Yes, I promise to try.",
        "Oh, my princess! Pray tell, are you seeking a book?",
        "I could not disagree more! To me, you will always be that dazzling songstress, that veritable princess of the opera. From ages five to eleven, I never missed a single one of your performances. Seeing you on stage was like glimpsing heaven. I was overcome with bliss.",
        "An elegant coalescence of beautiful song and frenetic swordplay. That was the most memorable aspect for me. Onstage, weapon in hand, letting your ballad soar to the heavens... Honestly, the first time I held a sword, it was not to train. I was trying to do your sword dance.",
        "Correct! It is all thanks to you.",
        "The honor is all mine. You blessed me by returning to my life. No matter where I go, or who I end up marrying, my childhood memory of you is inscribed in the deepest depths of my heart.",
        "Is something the matter?",
        "♪ How the crimson rain of pain it came, falling hard upon a land aflame. When the sacred blade it split the sky, until the heavens heard our cry... In the hour of vengeance, will you heed the call? On the red fields of revenge, will you help avenge? We must fight strong and stand tall! ♪",
        "Manuela, ah, hello! What a treat. It is most rare to see you at the training grounds. I have never had the honor of sparring with a princess. Why not grab a sword?",
        "So, you heard me... I hope it was not too grating on your ears.",
        "No, that was...wonderful! Exactly the voice I recall from my childhood. To have witnessed this performance in such an intimate setting... I am deeply moved! I cannot stop trembling. I feel as though I am going to cry. You have shaken me to my very core!",
        "You made a little boy's cherished dream come true. Perhaps you can help realize one more.",
        "'''' Would you do the sword dance with me—the one that accompanied the song? It had a part for a male performer if I recall. I would be truly honored.",
        "'''' Thank you so much. That has long been a dream of mine, and you made it a reality.",
        "All thanks to you. You inspired me.",
        "Life is a series of peaks and valleys. Our reunion is, to my mind, the highest of peaks.",
        "To think, we were once a pair of bloom, flourishing side by side in the upper echelons of Enbarr society. Despite our differing aspirations, I think together we could have taken the mantle of leading the Empire.",
        "Some part of me clung to hope that you might emerge from the wreckage. I am glad you have.",
        "I know that was a difficult time for you.",
        "Oh! That was rather brusque.",
        "I... I... I did not intend to offend you, Constance.",
        "That is simply not true. I care about you, and I was attempting to offer some words of comfort.",
        "You have my sincerest apologies. That was a grave misstep. I did not mean to come across as condescending. I was merely being careless with my words. As you say, I have never experienced loss at such a staggering magnitude. I cannot imagine the pain you have endured.",
        "Constance, please!",
        "Hello, Constance.",
        "Oh dear. I am not used to hearing you deprecate yourself like that. Never mind, just listen.",
        "When we last spoke, I was attempting to connect with you, to listen and show you some empathy. But I was so clumsy with my words that I came across as callous and conceited. I hurt you, I know.",
        "No. Please, hear me out. Though your words chafed, I see now that they were perceptive. I was being arrogant. I tend to...overcompensate. Perhaps I make a fool of myself, bragging about my superiority to Edelgard.",
        "If that was the right path, the wrong path hardly bears thinking about. Still, your kindness has eased my worries a bit.",
        "Your persistence is admirable.",
        "Aha! Is there something I can do for you, Constance?",
        "Well, what is it?",
        "I do not follow. Please clarify what you mean.",
        "Oh, yes... You must be referring to the oblique request you made concerning peaks and valleys. Not seeing a peak ahead of you, you hoped I might help lift you out of your lowly sta—",
        "You want me to forget the occasion you just asked me to remember. I see. Before I discard this memory entirely, might I be so bold as to ask...why?",
        "I see. What a curious situation.",
        "The hand of fate stripped everything from me, leaving me vulnerable and exposed. To borrow your words...I was in a valley and a thick shroud of fog obscured the peak before me. Now the cloud has lifted a bit, and I can see a glimpse of what lies ahead.",
        "There is a towering cliff for you to scale...and a long, rocky path lying ahead of me. Rather than ascending separately, we can join hands and face these obstacles together. Then we can reach the heights of our forebears--or, dare I say, even higher.",
        "And what might that be?",
        "Huh? I was being sincere, you know!"

        "Ah, wonderful! I was hoping you might enlighten me. About yourself, that is. You see, I happen to be quite curious about you.",
        "Well, because. There is something different about you. You possess an air of mystery... I could not help but notice when first we met. I am intrigued, to say the least. I find it rather difficult to put into words... Were I to wax poetic, I would say you remind me of the sea. Have you ever been, Professor?",
        "The sea is vast. Boundless. On the surface, all seems still. Yet beneath that stillness, it is unfathomably deep.

You cannot see it at a glance, but it is there all the same.",

Not unlike you. You are calm–you carry yourself with poise. Yet you wield great power. My brother is uncertain of you, however. He referred to you as a youth of...dubious origin. Oh, but please do not think ill of him! He is incredibly dedicated to his work. So surely you understand why he would have doubts about one of whom he knows so little. Nobody even seems to know your age! Incidentally, how old are you?",
        "Hmm... Looking at you, it is quite difficult for me to determine. I wonder... Could you be younger than your own students?",
        "Who, me? Well, I'm roughly the same age as the other youths here!",
        "Be that as it may, it is simply not the case. Oh, by the way, I... I have actually been considering enrolling in the academy myself. But my brother will not allow it. He is a touch overprotective at times... Oh! My apologies! I am sure you have much work to do. I will not keep you any longer! We must speak again sometime...if that would be all right. Have a lovely day!",
        "It has been a while since we last spoke, Professor. Spare me a moment again, will you not?",

        "Excuse me? Are you implying that I am still naive? I will have you know that I have made many friends, and am constantly learning new things! Why, when I go to the market–alone–I even haggle! You must be familiar with the delicate art of haggling– in which one negotiates a lower asking price for an item. That is the type of knowledge common only to those as mature as myself!",
        "Who, me? Um, have you not asked this once before? It is a bit rude to ask repeatedly, you know.",
        "Is that so? Well, it seems we have something in common, since I do not know your age either. Come now. There is nothing to be gained from focusing so heavily on age. Touching on a previous discussion, I think I have learned more about you. I mentioned how you possess an air of mystery... I compared you to any old sea, but I have come to realize you are more like a particular sea–one I have seen before. When I was quite small, my mother would take me out to play in the sea. She was an excellent fisher, my mother. I grew to love fish deeply because of her...",
        "Well, you see, fish are– Oh, er, wait. I was talking about the sea, was I not? Anyhow... I sense that, like the sea, your depths are seemingly impenetrable. Yet, despite your unknowable depths, there is something...familiar about you. It is as if we have met somewhere, long, long ago...",
        "No, I do not think so. It is all quite strange, really. I wonder if we might be distant relatives... No, that cannot be it, either. After all, if we were related, that would mean... Hm, though considering all that Rhea has done, it is not entirely outside the realm of possibility... Hm? Oh, apologies. Just muttering to myself. It is nothing. Mutterings aside, I mean to say that you do not feel like a stranger to me. For whatever reason, I feel deeply connected to you. And for this, I am glad.",
        "Oh, hello, Professor! How nice to see you. You caught me off guard. I was actually just thinking about you.",
        "Just a moment ago? Well, I... I... I am afraid I just do not understand you. When we first met, I sensed something different about you — something mysterious. And now I am convinced. Your existence itself is very special. Thinking on it, I know it to be true. You have a Crest that should have been lost long ago. You wield the Sword of the Creator as if it is nothing... Your hair and eye color changed on that day five years ago. To the same sort of color as mine and my brother's...",
        "I do not know. My brother refuses to speak to me of it. Since then, you have led us into battle and, thus far, we have always come out victorious. Your comrades and colleagues adore you. They believe in you — in your strength. I doubt there is a single soul who is likened to you. Who are you really?",
        "I simply do not understand. Whatever the case may be, having hair like mine is proof that there is something exceptional about you. I may as well come forward with things. I, too, am unlike others.",
        "Surely you recall that I was targeted, specifically for my blood? I may not be special in the ways you are, but my blood is rare. It seems the two of us share a special... differentness. I also believe that we are bound together in some way. Of this I am certain. Therefore, I intend to stay by your side and watch over you. Your existence must be preserved at all cost.",
        "Certainly those are the words of a hero! Let us unite our powers — together, we are unstoppable!",
        "Tell me... What is it you are actually trying to say?",
        "You cannot possibly be serious. How can this be true? You are sincerely saying that the progenitor god, Sothis, dwells within you and that you have inherited her power? That is utterly...bizarre.",
        "If I may be so bold, do you consider yourself male or female? I have only ever heard of you referred to as a male, but Sothis is most assuredly female. Am I to believe that you are a male goddess? I am not certain how much sense that makes... I suppose there are circumstances by which such a thing is possible...",
        "Oh, are you not? But if you have inherited her power, then surely the two of you have become one. Gah, it all makes my head spin. I suppose I will take your word for it.",
        "This is a ring... Oh my, it is beautiful! So delicate and feminine. Is this your ring? So then, you walk around with a women's ring. Surely this is proof that–",
        "Am I? Oh! Oh, wait! Now I recall! I have heard that it is customary to bestow a ring upon the person one wishes to marry. Which would mean... Hmm. Does this mean what I think it means?",
        "Me? You? Us? You mean to tell me that you have fallen in love... with me?",
        "I think I might faint! I... No one has ever... Well, of course they have not. My apologies. I am quite taken aback! Are you most certain I am the one whom you love?",
        "I always knew there was a deep, special bond between us. I never quite imagined that it might develop into this. Or...perhaps I did imagine it. Often. I must ask once more–are you certain that you are not the goddess Sothis?",

Hm, though considering all that Rhea has done, it is not entirely outside the realm of possibility... Hm? Oh, apologies. Just muttering to myself. It is nothing. Mutterings aside, I mean to say that you do not feel like a stranger to me. For whatever reason, I feel deeply connected to you. And for this, I am glad.",
        "Oh, hello, Professor! How nice to see you. You caught me off guard. I was actually just thinking about you.",
        "Just a moment ago? Well, I... I... I am afraid I just do not understand you. When we first met, I sensed something different about you — something mysterious. And now I am convinced. Your existence itself is very special. Thinking on it, I know it to be true. You have a Crest that should have been lost long ago. You wield the Sword of the Creator as if it is nothing... Your hair and eye color changed on that day five years ago. To the same sort of color as mine and my brother's...",
        "I do not know. My brother refuses to speak to me of it. Since then, you have led us into battle and, thus far, we have always come out victorious. Your comrades and colleagues adore you. They believe in you — in your strength. I doubt there is a single soul who is likened to you. Who are you really?",
        "I simply do not understand. Whatever the case may be, having hair like mine is proof that there is something exceptional about you. I may as well come forward with things. I, too, am unlike others.",
        "Surely you recall that I was targeted, specifically for my blood? I may not be special in the ways you are, but my blood is rare. It seems the two of us share a special... differentness. I also believe that we are bound together in some way. Of this I am certain. Therefore, I intend to stay by your side and watch over you. Your existence must be preserved at all cost.",
        "Certainly those are the words of a hero! Let us unite our powers — together, we are unstoppable!",
        "Indeed I am. I have been working away on this meal for hours, now. The only thing is... Each time it is my turn to tend to the meals, those in the dining hall seem to miraculously become very busy and evacuate the premises. I make the food, but nobody is ever here to eat it! I do not understand what the issue is–it is such a waste. Even my brother seems to evaporate every time I am in the kitchen. It is quite...peculiar.",
        "Really?! I mean... Yes, Yes, please have some! It is not perfect, but I am certain it will taste quite nice, all the same.",
        "You...you liked it? Wow, nobody has ever liked anything I have cooked! If I cannot get anyone else to eat this meal, though, it is going to spoil and go to waste... It is no secret to me that I am not very good at cooking...",
        "You...you actually want...more?",
        "There is no need for false flattery. The few times I have asked my brother whether or not he enjoyed my cooking, he could not even give me a straight answer. My own brother!",
        "Hm, perhaps! I hope you enjoy the rest of the meal!",
        "Why are you out and about so late, Dimitri?",
        "Me? I was feeling restless and came here to think.",
        "How funny! But...are you feeling well? You look fairly pale.",
        "Oh my, headaches are quite troublesome, are they not? I am sure it will subside soon! Actually, I am quite talented when it comes to healing magic. If you will allow me, I will have you feeling better in no time.",
        "But...why not? Have I offended you somehow?",
        "I see. That would explain your somber demeanor. Still, I do not agree with all you are saying. I feel that if I were your father, or any of your dear friends whom you lost... I would want you to let go of me eventually. I would never want someone whom I care deeply for to be pained by the loss of me for eternity. And I doubt they would want that either.",
        "We cannot ask them directly, but we can imagine how they might have felt. You know who they were as people. As for me, if I am ever to be but a memory in your future, I want you to remember me in a way that brings you joy. I would want you to smile when you recalled me, to feel warmed by the notion that I cherished your company. I cannot imagine I am the only one who feels this way. Surely anyone who loved another would wish only for their peace and happiness.",
        "I...must apologize. I was out of line, clearly. I must get some rest now. Please do not stay up too late yourself.",
        "Up this late practicing with your lance, are you?",
        "Well, in a certain sense, yes. Can you spare a moment?",
        "Thank you. I want to apologize to you. When last we spoke, I mishandled the situation.",
        "You did?",
        "My cooking certainly is not something people often compliment me on...",
        "An apology is not necessary. You were only trying to be kind, after all.",
        "Just the same, it was nice to hear. Hey, I have an idea! What if you sampled some really pungent food? Or something extremely spicy! Maybe that would–",
        "Uh... Yes?",
        "No need for the flattery! Anyhow, maybe someday you will get your taste back. I hope then you will be able to compliment me sincerely about my cooking.",
        "Listen, Dimitri... The truth is...I am afraid of sleeping.",
        "I am afraid that when I close my eyes, I shall fall into a very deep sleep. One from which I cannot wake up...for years upon years. Then when I finally awaken, everyone I know and love will be long gone. Vanished with the sands of time. I am sure it seems silly, but try as I might, I cannot shake this fear.",
        "I appreciate the sentiment. Even so, one day...",
        "Oh? What is that?",
        "I am not so sure that is a good thing...",
        "I...",
        "You really do not pick up on subtle cues, do you?",
        "Well. It is all a part of your charm, I suppose. With you here, I finally feel I can sleep without having to worry at all. Hnhh...",
        "Someday you...appreciate...food...",
        "As expected, I am not finding anything at all...",
        "Oh, I was just hoping for general reading that might illustrate the lives of city dwellers.",
        "I haven't need of official records or anything of the like. Just some light reading on the subject.",
        "Oh, you know, books that cover things like what types of activities young people enjoy—how they spend their free time. Popular fashions and trends—things of that sort. And even, perhaps...stories about romance.",
        "My brother? I am afraid I do not follow.",
        "I see... I did not realize he had a hand in such things. Well, I suppose it really is no use searching here.",
        "Well, truth be told, I am not particularly well versed in the ways of ordinary people. Seteth never taught me of such things, and he strictly forbade me from spending much time out and about on my own.",
        "I understand and appreciate that he acted from a place of concern, of course.",
        "Hm?",
        "Oh course not! No, no. Y-you are mistaken.",
        "I was not aware that my speech differed so greatly from my companions. Do I really sound so... formal to you?",
        "Hello there, Claude. No, not particularly. I was merely looking.",
        "This again? There is truly nothing of interest to discuss on that topic.",
        "Might I suggest giving up entirely? Truth be told, my brother has asked that I not speak of my background to anyone.",
        "You've concocted a theory, have you? I suppose there is no harm in listening to it.",
        "Where did you learn of this?",
        "You mean to suggest that my brother and I are the children's children's children of Cethleann?",
        "An interesting theory, to say the least. But surely you must know... Saint Cethleann was never married. There are no tales of her having ever had children.",
        "About what, exactly?",
        "Well, yes. I see no reason to hide that fact.",
        "Ha! Such flattery.",
        "That is not something I am willing to share, unfortunately. However, since you are so passionate on the matter, I will promise you something.",
        "If you somehow manage to uncover the truth of my identity, I will acknowledge it as truth.",
        "If you do somehow figure it out, then I would ask something of you, Claude. I would ask that you reveal your own true identity.",
        "It has been clear to me for quite some time now that you are no ordinary noble. I have been pondering...well, you...quite a lot lately. The curiosity is enough to drive me mad!",
        "I have told you already, I am quite alright!",
        "I do not care what you have to say! I could not bear to stand here and do nothing!",
        "Eavesdropping, were you? Well, you are spot on. I do wish he would leave me be and learn to trust me.",
        "And what is that?",
        "Um, pardon me?",
        "**'''' How can you be so sure? Hilda's brother and Raphael are quite similar, are they not?",
        "I imagine that is because I...",
        "Have you confronted my brother with your theory?",
        "That sounds most entertaining. I would love to see you give it a try. Perhaps you could request, \"Father, please grant me your daughter's hand in marriage!\" Hahaha! Ah, I can feel my face turning red!",
        "Do you mean to say that the right time will come eventually, then? Hmm?",
        "As though this were something easily shelved! This topic holds far more appeal than that of identities, if you ask me!",
        "What is that lovely smell? It seems to be coming from the training area... What could it be?",
        "Good day to you, Ferdinand. You smell amazing. That is you I am smelling, is it not?",
        "Aha! Yes, that is the smell, all right!",
        "I see. I thought maybe you were doing some cooking — you smell a bit like food. But I suppose that is the oil tricking my nose.",
        "Not really, no...But is that oil not also used for cooking? For things like frying meat or drizzling a nice, crisp salad. Things of that nature? Were I to coat my armor in oil that smells of food, I would be distracted by hunger at all times!",
        "I suppose you are right. And actually... all this talk of delicious oil has made me hungry!",
        "I must apologize, Ferdinand, but I cannot wait even a moment for you. I am famished! I shall be in the dining hall, getting my fill of fried goodies!",
        "Good day, Ferdinand! Working on your armor again?",
        "As usual? It is not as though I am always searching for a meal! I just... I am rather interested in armor! Do you mind if I peer over your shoulder while you work?",
        "Thank you for allowing me the pleasure! Ooooo! So many different types! Wow! Helmets, armor, gauntlets... The range of defensive items seems innumerable! This one seems different from the rest of them. It is akin to a gauntlet, except—",
        "Huh? Ahh! ''''",
        "I am well... But what was that?",
        "No, I am the one who was overly curious and reached out without permission. My apologies. But... um... when you snatched me out of harm's way, you... er... embraced me quite tightly...",
        "No, it is not that at all! It is just... you hugged me so tight...",
        "Not at all! Not— not in the slightest... Anyway, I had better be on my way. ''''",
        "Why would you need to do that?",
        "I'm not sure that's entirely the case...",
        "To be perfectly honest, I felt a bit embarrassed. When you embraced me before, it really caught me off guard. You're surprisingly strong for how slender you appear. Anyway, it all got me rather flustered.",
        "I see! So you have a well of strength for embracing people, it seems!",
        "Is that so? Ah, so the embrace was nothing more than a rescue. Perhaps I was flustered needlessly. I wonder... if you would consider embracing me when my life is not in peril?",
        "Because I'd like to feel that way again. That's why. How about it? Or is your capacity for embracing limited exclusively to warfare?",
        "Ah! I'm delighted! Does right now work for you?",
        "Agreed. Better to let this be our little secret.",
        "Now then, where is that book on dance...",
        "Hello, Linhardt. What is it?",
        "I know a little of her, as do many. But what does this have to do with me?",
        "I am quite certain that it does not, as a matter of fact.",
        "I do not appreciate your disrespectful approach to this topic.",
        "I actually meant that you are being disrespectful to Saint Cethleann.",
        "If you must...",
        "Yes, I do. I am confident in my abilities. I am glad of my abilities, for it is a way in which I am able to help others.",
        "I am very busy searching for a book. I will be going now.",
        "Another one, Linhardt? When will you leave me in peace?",
        "A major crest of Saint Cethleann, correct?",
        "I am aware.",
        "Oh, is it?",
        "You and I, related? I am quite certain that is not the case.",
        "No, I do not, however—",
        "It's true she's unmarried. Er, was unmarried, that is. I hate to disappoint you, but I'm not a descendant of Saint Cethleann. Of this I can assure you.",
        "What was that you were mumbling to yourself?",
        "He always acts so oddly... It makes me ill at ease.",
        "Ah! Good day, Linhardt. At the moment, I'm simply browsing history books.",
        "I have knowledge of how people lived, who they loved, what wars they fought and why... But I'd never describe it as feeling like I was living in the past.",
        "It's only a figure of speech.",
        "Goodness, this again?",
        "A troublesome experiment? You know I do not like pain.",
        "I beg your pardon?!",
        "Are you actually speaking about a hypothetical future with me? Involving...children?!",
        "Do you mind going back to what you mentioned earlier?",
        "The part about marrying and having children! I've always believed, rather firmly, that marriage is something between two people who love one another.",
        "This is the first I've heard of such a thing from you!",
        "Does conversing with me tire you out so much?",
        "Experimental marriage and children? He likes me? I don't understand. I don't understand at all.",
        "Ahhh, tonight's meal looks exquisite! Time for me to make the most of this opportunity. MmmMmMmm!",
        "I am not sure it is your business to tell me how to consume my meal. You must admit this food is absolutely delectable! I have not eaten something this tasty in ages!",
        "I suppose my enthusiasm is a tad overwhelming. Do you happen to know who cooked this meal?",
        "You are the chef?!",
        "I...I do not think I have ever been brought to tears by a meal... Dedue, you are a chef without peer! Why, that was truly more delicious than anything I have eaten in all my years!",
        "No need for modesty. I could certainly never make anything even remotely so delicious. Hmm, that gives me an idea. Will you please teach me how to cook such delicacies as the one I ate just now?",
        "Indeed! I have never been so emotional over cuisine — you must teach me your ways!",
        "I would not dream of it! Thank you, Chef Dedue!",
        "Certainly, Chef Dedue.",
        "No, not in the slightest! I just got momentarily sleepy. It happens to me from time to time... Let me see... First, chop the vegetables. Coming right up, Che— Er, Dedue!",
        "I am so bored... Day in and day out, it is nothing but dicing vegetables and waiting for water to boil. I want to feel like I am actually cooking. It is not as though I do not know the basics... He could at least let me hold the spatula sometime...",
        "Chef Dedue, I was hoping to speak with you regarding something that has been on my mind.",
        "Surely you have noticed my skill while wielding pans and knives. Therefore, I think it is time you taught me how to cook— beyond all this water boiling and vegetable chopping business.",
        "But why?!",
        "Come now! You have seen how I use a ladle! You know I'm good for it. Hmph. He has left me no option but to take matters into my own hands. Stubborn you may be, Chef Dedue, but I will show you the true meaning of delicious!",
        "Er... Hello there, Dedue... I just want to say that I am really, terribly sorry.",
        "I, um... I tried to cook. On my own. It was an absolute disaster. Adding that seasoning... Adding all that seasoning. Ugh, what a mistake.",
        "But Chef— that is, Dedue! I defied your instructions! Quite blatantly, I might add. I tried to cook before I had gained mastery over the tools. I have been a terrible student... Are you going to stop teaching me now?",
        "Not in the slightest. I desperately want to learn from you.",
        "You... I... Truly?!",
        "You... you actually ate the food I made?",
        "I learned by watching you.",
        "I was certain you would be angry with me. It is decided, then. Someday, you will exclaim that something I have made is delicious. I do not quite know how many years it will take, but I am willing to rise to the challenge. Please, help me get there!",
        "Of course, Chef— er, Dedue, rather.",
        "Oh! This is exciting! Let me see... Chef Dedue! Master Chef Doodah? Ooh, Supreme Chef Deddie-pie!",
        "Oh, I know! Chef Deddles!",
        "Spectacular work, Felix!",
        "Oh, uh—My apologies! I simply thought you were doing a great job... Just how sharp is that blade of yours, Felix? Do you imagine you might be able to cut something cleanly with it?",
        "Ah, wonderful! I have a special request for you, then.",
        "I do. I shall toss them one by one to you, and you shall make a sweeping blow to slice them!",
        "I saw a knight do it once, so surely you can as well. Or perhaps you are worried that you are not capable.",
        "Right! Show me what you are made of. Here it co—",
        "All of them? If you insist! Here we go!",
        "Wow, you truly are spectacular!",
        "You are undoubtedly the most revered wood cutter in all the land. Now I am intrigued—next time, let us try an even larger wood pile!",
        "Oh no! My surprise is spoiled! I had brought some fruits for you to cut up, in addition to the firewood. I thought some variation might prove amusing!",
        "I cannot imagine what could be better than chopping fruit.",
        "You say that as though you have many enemies. So you would rather chop people than firewood, is that it?",
        "Surely it is not forbidden to use your sword for other things. Like chopping fruit. Swords that cut inanimate objects are serving a much finer purpose than those that cut living beings.",
        "And what purpose might that be?",
        "He certainly is a stubborn one...",
        "Felix!",
        "Do not fret. I have not come to ask you to chop wood. I have other things to speak of with you. You said that for one to live, they must also be prepared to kill.",
        "No, I do not have a problem with it at all. I simply want you to live too.",
        "Excuse me. I am not finished yet. During this time of war, you must wield your sword to ensure your own life. If that is the case, then it follows that we should bring an end to this war.",
        "Perhaps that is true. But once all is said and done, there would no longer be a need to kill, only to live. Is that not so?",
        "I do not think that is anything you should worry yourself over. If the war ends and peace reigns, I shall be sure to have plenty of wood chopping for you to do!",
        "And! You will never be short on fruits and vegetables to chop for me either! If you felt like you lost your purpose in life, surely you would find a new purpose. It is not like you to be afraid of losing something, after all.",
        "Oh, that brings me such joy, Felix! Together, we can make this a reality. I can see it now— a life where you slice vegetables rather than people. I will greatly enjoy the day when we inhabit a world like that.",
        "Now just a moment, Sylvain. If you must speak with me, I implore you to do so from where you stand. My apologies if this comes across as rude, but please do not come any closer to me.",
        "I am sorry— my brother has explicitly warned me not to go near you.",
        "He used those very words! Is it true, then?",
        "Of course I would prefer to believe that, but no one can never know for certain. Particularly when similar stories are constantly in circulation about you. I have heard that men and women alike have been seduced by your nefarious ways.",
        "I have heard you toy with people's emotions, like a cat toys with its prey.",
        "Well, perhaps not. You do not strike me as much of a charmer.",
        "Did I not tell you, Sylvain?! Stay away from me!",
        "Truly, there are countless terrible stories of your behavior. I've heard that you panic when there aren't women around to flirt with. That's you've gone as far as flirting with horses and even chickens!",
        "I would like to believe that you are a sincere and reputable person, Sylvain. But there is no smoke without fire, or so the saying goes.",
        "Until I can be certain, please refrain from coming too close to me. Now if you will excuse me, I must be on my way.",
        "Sylvain...",
        "I wanted to apologize about my treatment of you earlier, Sylvain. I am not normally one to put stock in such rumors...",
        "Oh, I am so sorry to hear of your illness! Perhaps my magic will help heal you.",
        "No? Are you not ill, then?",
        "Of course. Sylvain, I look forward to getting to know you without the falsity of rumors.",
        "You would treat me to a feast? That is very kind of you.",
        "I hear that very frequently. Thank you.",
        "Anyway, what type of a meal were you considering, Sylvain? I would love some seafood, followed by a delicious cake! Oh, I am absolutely famished, as I often am. Shall we be on our way?",
        "Yet another lovely day! On such a fine day as this, it would certainly be nice to go for a stroll with someone. I wonder if anyone is around... Oh, my... Such... awful noises! Who— or rather— what is making those sounds?",
        "Eep!",
        "M-my apologies. I feel a bit better now...",
        "You startled me— appearing out of nowhere and making such sounds! What is it you are doing here, anyway?",
        "Wow! Are you really capable of lifting something so massive, Raphael?",
        "That was magnificent! Do you suppose I could give it a try as well?",
        "Tiny or not, I want to be stronger. Do you have any tips for someone both willing and eager to grow?",
        "Ah, you are a font of knowledge! Can you apply your wisdom and show me by example?",
        "Yah! Hragh!",
        "Oorah! Ngharh!",
        "How did I fare? Do I look stronger now?",
        "It's working! I knew this would help!",
        "Hello, Raphael! Are you well? Any chance you might be training today?",
        "I imagine so! Mind if I tag along? I have been practicing my battle cries — I believe you shall notice a marked improvement! Raaaah! Yaaaah!",
        "Oh, hearing it anew is positively invigorating! I have much training ahead if I am to be as strong as you.",
        "I won't be satisfied until my body is as strong as my mind! As my body is so frail, my brother is endlessly worrying over me.",
        "Then surely you understand. I want to give my brother peace of mind. If I don't get stronger, I won't be able to do all the things I wish to do. But I'm quite enjoying this! I have never shouted so loudly in all my life! Each time I allow myself to let go in such a way, I feel invigorated!",
        "Just you wait — I've only just begun!",
        "Kyaaaa! Raaaaah!",
        "Wraaagh! Urraaaaah!",
        "Urrhaaaaaa! Hyuuuuurgh!",
        "Ah, thank you. This water tastes absolutely divine.",
        "I'm not so sure I'm stronger, but somehow, when I shout, I'm able to move more books than normal. Although my brother becomes very anxious anytime he hears me shouting. I do suppose my body feels a bit sturdier now though! I'm so very grateful to you, Raphael.",
        "But... doesn't all this shouting keep you from your precious workout regimen?",
        "Isn't that wonderful! Come along, Raphael's muscles — we can do this! It is my wish that someday, I'll be able to lift a log all on my own with these arms of mine.",
        "Invincible! I like the sound of that!",
        "Wraaagh! Urraaaaah!",
        "Urrhaaaaa! Hyuuuuuurgh!",
        "Oh!",
        "No. No need for concern. I am quite all right.",
        "No, nothing of the sort. I just got a bit dizzy, standing up so quickly.",
        "Come now — I appreciate the concern, but I am quite all right? Look, I am perfectly fine now. See?",
        "Ignatz?",
        "Are you...there?",
        "Mmhmmm, I understand now.",
        "Though I know little regarding affairs of the heart, even I can clearly see one's intent when they stare so much. I am sorry, but at the moment, I am not looking for... Well...",
        "You just? Just what? What is it?",
        "Fascinated? By me?",
        "I see.",
        "No, not at all. Tell me... What are your thoughts on Saint Cethleann, exactly?",
        "Very good! As a reward, I shall not report your behavior to my brother... This time.",
        "Well then, farewell. Perhaps we will have another chance to chat later.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "And why is it you're doing that, precisely?",
        "Well! How lovely! But how is researching her exploits necessary for painting?",
        "Ah, so you were hoping to find out what type of girl she was?",
        "I see! Yes, yes, it is all quite clear to me now.",
        "OK then. Allow me to share with you what I know of Cethleann's deeds!",
        "Long ago, in a world ravaged by war, Cethleann led a secluded life with her father, Cichol. One day, they met Saint Seiros, who was grieved by the chaos and destruction of war. And so, the three decided to join forces.",
        "At the Battle of Tailtean, they fought against the 10 Elites led by Nemesis, who sought to conquer the whole world... Cethleann tended to her allies on the field of battle, until she exhausted all her strength. Then, she fell into a long slumber.",
        "Interesting story, is it not? Have you perhaps learned something new about Cethleann?",
        "Incredible?! Well! I haven't heard that before. I feel certain you and I will be fast friends. Let us talk again soon!",
        "Oh, hello, Ignatz. What an unexpected surprise.",
        "No wonder I've repeatedly felt someone's eyes boring holes into the back of my head lately. You're quite lucky my brother hasn't noticed. It would be wise to back away from me, before he does. Although... I shall agree to your request, on the understanding that you paint me to be more illustrious than Saint Cethleann.",
        "Am I not the more illustrious — the more breathtaking?",
        "An admirer, hm? You say such funny things.",
        "Now then, would you like me to pose? I have many ideas up my sleeve!",
        "Are you certain about that? It sounds rather... dull. How long will it take you?",
        "Actually! I have changed my mind. No longer do you need to paint me as illustrious. Instead, paint me as... fierce!",
        "Did you not just say that Saint Cethleann had an impressive and fierce way about her? Well, if that is the case, then I, too, would like to look fierce. You're welcome to paint me repeatedly until you get the expressiveness just right! Rather, you must paint me repeatedly until I am satisfied with the outcome.",
        "Not at all! We are friends, aren't we? I am happy to help with a friend's request, even if it takes centuries to complete.",
        "You worry too much, Brother.",
        "Had that not happened, I would have never been allowed to join the professor's class. Even from something so dire, some good did come of it.",
        "I am very much aware of that. You wanted to speak to me of something?",
        "I do appreciate the offer, but all the students and professors have treated me exceptionally well.",
        "You worry far too much. There is truly nothing to share. And nothing for you to fret over!",
        "Enough! I made it clear that nothing is wrong. I stand by my word. Well, there is one concern that comes to mind...",
        "There is a certain somebody who seems determined to get in the way of my friendships with my classmates.",
        "It is you, Brother. Now then, I must be on my way.",
        "Brother!",
        "I thought I made it clear that I do not want you meddling in the affairs of me and my friends!",
        "It has come to my attention that you have been running around asking people what they think of me. Asking everyone!",
        "I cannot emphasize enough how embarrassed I was when I found out. And you have caused such a stir for those whom you questioned! Why, one person even said he feared for his life when you cornered him in the dining hall!",
        "He is nothing more than a friend! Kindly keep out of my social business in the future.",
        "Who I befriend is absolutely none of your business! Do you know what they call people like you? Overprotective meddlers! I am no longer a child. Are you incapable of trusting me, even a little?",
        "As my brother?",
        "Oh, never mind it, if you'll excuse me.",
        "Here to pester me, Brother?",
        "Regardless of what I say to you, it is not as though it has any effect in reducing your worry over me.",
        "Of that I am well aware. I am touched that you care so deeply. When I think of it, it is my own fault that you have become so overprotective. I cannot blame you.",
        "Ever since then, I have been afraid of falling asleep. My fear of sleeping is outmatched only by my fear of spending my life alone. Even if it cannot last, I want to live among my peers as one of them—as an ordinary person. Similar to how you and Mother coexisted with your own comrades back then, fighting side by side.",
        "Father...",
        "Nobody is listening, Father. Let me address you as such just this once. I have valued the quiet days you and I have spent alone together. But I am no longer a child. Just as you and Mother met one another, and eventually I was brought into the world, I—",
        "It seems I have no choice in the matter. I shall allow you to worry about me enough for yourself and Mother both. But only that much and no more, my dear father, Cichol.",
        "Hello, Professor Manuela! I wish you to know that I have heard ever so much about your talents.",
        "Singing! Why, you are...you are wonderfully skilled at it, are you not? Why, I have even overheard people saying your voice is akin to the singing of a goddess!",
        "Oh, the students are always speaking of it. Which got me to thinking... I may be the only person in all of the academy who's never heard your beautiful voice in song. So...I was wondering, Manuela. Might you sing a little something for me?",
        "Middle... Frank? Um...what do those words mean, precisely?",
        "Oh wow, in all of Enbarr? They must not have been around when I was living there...",
        "Indeed. Although, I was quite a bit younger at the time. It is where I was born, as a matter of fact.",
        "Ah, yes, that could be! And...what, precisely, is the function of an opera troupe?",
        "I-I understand now! I certainly have experience in the fine art of storytelling. There is often singing, as a part of story time for the children at the monastery.",
        "Theaters, they're called? You mean to say that there are buildings exclusively used for...telling stories?",
        "Hello, Manuela. I was just wondering—what was it like, back when you were involved with that opera troupe? Your life must have been quite different from how it is here, I imagine.",
        "It sounds like a world all its own. Thank you— I find the topic fascinating. What sort of roles did you tend to be cast in? As the lead performer, did you play the part of a princess much? Oh! I can only imagine how illustrious that would be!",
        "Wondrous. It all sounds so very glamorous. Despite how rigorous a schedule you kept, it sounds like the hard work was worth those fleeting moments on stage. Mine has always been a...quiet life. It is hard not to feel a twinge of envy, hearing such stories from you!",
        "What... What do you mean?",
        "Oh, please! I would love to hear all about it!",
        "Manuela, do you recall what you told me? You mentioned that \"if a place shines brighter than anywhere else, then its shadows will be darker too.\"",
        "It most certainly did not sound like a joke. Can you please elaborate? Of course, I love hearing about your glamorous past performing on stage. But all that glamor doesn't account for the shadows you spoke of.",
        "Not at all. Understanding you more deeply, I can see how much strength has been required of you all this time.",
        "I am well aware that survival and striving for dreams sometimes means doing things we would not normally do. Perhaps because you have been so strong-lived with such conviction... Perhaps that is why your songs have touched so many people's hearts.",
        "I would like to rescind my original request of you.",
        "Indeed. Instead, I have a different request. I would like to see you perform an opera. On stage.",
        "It follows, then, that you have developed new insights, charm, and wisdom to share.",
        "Agreed! Let us make the curtain fall on this war as soon as possible. Maybe then we can raise the curtain on a brand new performance! That'd be something, wouldn't it?"

        "True. I suppose we did only meet a handful of times.",
        "Haggard, eh? True enough.",
        "I was unable to protect the king. That is the ultimate failure. One I must atone for.",
        "That would do nothing to atone for the dead.",
        "You do not understand.",
        "There was no other choice but for me to leave. What would you have done if you were in my place? If His Highness had died due to your failures?",
        "Forget those words spoken by His Highness. I am no different a man than I was before... Beaten down by sin. Alone and weak. I am lost and irredeemable.",
        "Impressive that you made it back, Dedue. It was you who saved His Highness from prison... We— all of us— thought you were dead.",
        "Is that so...",
        "Stop. I left once... I have wondered if I will be forced to leave once more, after this battle is done.",

        "It is unlike you to be so talkative.",
        "So long as you understand... I will leave the Kingdom some day. It may not be until the day I die, but the time will come... This war... I'm a much older man than I was when it began.",
        "Sooner or later, someone must take my place. Do not try to carry the weight alone, Dedue. There are many talented and well-trained officers. Work together with them to assure our king's future. Do that, and when the time comes, I will rest well.",
        "Yes?",
        "A fair point. There's no reason to let old age make one timid.",
        "Is that so? Well then, we have more fighting ahead of us, Dedue. We should get to it... For the future of Faerghus.",
        "Excellent! Well done, Ashe. Continue such work, and you will certainly make a name for yourself.",
        "You really are amazing, you know. Your skills with the lance and bow are just incredible. One learns the craft of knighthood well after 40 years of service.",
        "Further training and service will only make you stronger. Yet, why spend your life this way? Knighthood is not glamorous. On long campaigns you sleep rough in all manner of weather, and may eat gruel more often than venison... It seems odd that you would admire me. Or that you would long to be a knight. Are you sure of yourself?",
        "I do not deserve your praise. I merely performed my duties to the best of my skill.",
        "Hmm. Tell me this... Once you don the armor, raise your shield, and level your lance... Why? What is it you wish to protect?",
        "You must know exactly what you protect before you become a knight.",
        "My duty has always been to protect my lord. That is a given for any knight, but for myself, doubly so. Then there are the personal reasons. Each knight has their own, yet mine... I do not speak of.",
        "Because it is personal. Mine. It allows me to focus on the work and grants me discipline. That is sufficient.",
        "Is something the matter? Your heart does not seem to be in your training today.",
        "Idle thoughts do hinder training. Tell me what bothers you.",
        "That...is difficult to explain. You are aware of the Tragedy of Duscur? When the king's party was massacred nine years ago?",
        "Forgive me. That must be a difficult memory.",
        "I disagree. Had I been by His Majesty's side on that day, where I was sworn to be... Perhaps His Majesty would not have lost his life, and all would be different.",
        "Yes. You may laugh, but I feel I was responsible for everything.",
        "You were adopted by Lord Lonato, correct? I once told you that I wished to protect one thing other than my king...and that is my family. My wife and my daughter, both of whom I left behind in the Kingdom. Lord Lonato took up his sword for his son. Even if that meant turning his back on the goddess... As a father, I cannot condemn Lord Lonato for raising an army.",
        "Yet, perhaps he too lost sight of what should be protected. Just as I did.",
        "You, Ashe. Because you are also his son.",

        "I still do it. When the mood strikes.",
        "I want nothing. I was carving and... I thought of you. I remembered how happy you would be, as a child, when I handed one of these dolls to you.",
        "Annette...",
        "If you don't need it, you can throw it away. It is all the same in the end. I am sorry, Annette. I should have given more thoughts to my actions. ''''",
        "Yes. Praying is all I can do. For I am at fault for each death upon the cursed plain of Duscur.",
        "It was my duty to protect the royal family. I should have given my life to protect the king. Even if His Highness has forgiven me, my knightly vows are still broken. My knighthood is lost.",

        "Annette...",
        "Take this.",
        "Look inside and you will understand. Should the contents make you sad, please burn them. ''''",
        "Of course.",
        "Yes.",

        "Training is difficult. A strain on the body. Surely it is natural for one to be...tense.",
        "I am sorry. It's simply how I am.",
        "I thank you for your advice, Professor Hanneman. But I cannot live as you do. Such a way of life...is not permitted to me. Now, if you will pardon me, I will return to my training.",
        "As I said before, I cannot change my nature.",
        "Professor Hanneman, may I ask a question first?",

        "You were lovely. Y-you sounded lovely.",
        "Why would you suppose I was dishonest?",
        "My lady Manuela, that could be no further from the truth.",
        "Why did she leave so suddenly? And what could she have meant by a duel? Something is surely troubling her...",
        "Oh!",
        "Oh!",
        "Since the beginning of your song. I am sorry. I did not mean to disturb you.",
        "I will not. Such performance would be a shame to forget. You were even livelier than before.",
        "What's the matter?",
        "Your voice must have drawn it from me. Obviously, I was taken by your beautiful voice... and also your impassioned form.",
        "You won your challenge, my lady Manuela. I concede defeat.",
        "Alois! You shouted. Is all well?",
        "Yet you were also raising your voice, which is not conducive to fishing.",
        "If I may, Alois, a bit of advice. You lifted the rod as soon as the fish bit.",
        "No. It is the very reason the fish escapes. The fish in this moat know to nibble the bait first. They check if it is safe before biting in earnest. Allow the first pull of the line. Then, when the second pull comes, reel in your prey.",
        "In fairness, I am more a theorist than fisherman. I just happen to know some things about this location.",
        "I am honored by your compliments, and I believe you could achieve mastery if you attend to the basics. With your permission, I might accompany you on a fishing expedition. Perhaps offer more pointers, if I may.",
        "Sir Alois. Have you also come to fish? If I am in your way, you need but say so.",
        "No, it is nothing of the sort. I am not here to catch a fish today.",
        "No... I am using this time to examine my past deeds. When I am fishing, the world fades, and I am left alone with myself.",
        "Perhaps the correct way to fish is the way you do, Alois. Simply for the pleasure. I deeply regret I am unable to be the angling companion you desire",
        "And what might that be?",
        "Is that so?",
        "We cannot know the minds of the departed. Therefore, we wrestle with their ghosts.",
        "Of course, it would be my pleasure.",
        "Eh? As I understood, you wounded your arm in battle. Were you not told to avoid exerting yourself for some time, so as to not aggravate the injury?",
        "Catherine, your wound was gravely deep, and should be given time to heal.",
        "Please... Speak not of such ill-omened thoughts. I could not bear to see you fall in battle, Cassandra— Oh! Pardon me. I am quite sorry, Catherine.",
        "I... I allowed my emotions to best my good sense. My deepest apologies.",
        "Yes... Agreed, agreed. It may be poor compensation for my gaffe, but I will aide you in your training if you are still interested. If you're completely certain you're healed and strong enough, that is...",
        "I have something I must ask you.",
        "Will you be going home?",
        "There must be those who, even now, wait for you. Believe in you. Now that Lord Lonato is dead, I can think of no one who would stop you from returning.",
        "I understand. In fact, that is the answer I expected from you.",
        "Five years ago, you chose to leave the knights... I'm guessing you don't regret that choice.",
        "But you have caused me to realize something about myself. The sight of you, swinging your sword to fulfill your duty, your birthplace left behind... It reminded me of my life before. Of the day I swore my vows and was made knight to my king.",
        "We are the same in that respect. On the day my liege bestowed upon me my sword... I knew protecting this man, fighting battles in his name, would be an irreplaceable joy. King, country, family, friends, beliefs. My list of what I longed to keep safe grew. Hence my realization. I did not become a knight so I could pray. I did so to fight.",
        "Good point. We should end the idle talk. Will you spar with me, Catherine? I believe it is much too early for me to lay down my lance forever.",
        "Hah. I am honored you think so."
    ],
    "Hanneman": [
        "Ah, Professor! Always a pleasure to see you. I wonder, might you have a moment to chat?",
        "Come now. You have no need to be on guard.",
        "I'd never cause you harm. You're far too valuable a specim— Well, that is to say, too valuable a member of the academy staff. Indeed, the further my Crest research progresses, the closer you come to learning the truth of your heritage. Is it not so? When I learned you bore the lost Crest—the very Crest of Flames itself!—I set about learning everything I could about your past. What was the origin of your bloodline? How have the events of your life been shaped by your lineage? I became somewhat obsessed, I must admit.",
        "Of course, I also contacted Jeralt and his mercenary friends. Your father does keep rather interesting company. I'm excited to share with you what I learned, but I do ask that you correct me if I am mistaken on any account. The story begins with Jeralt serving as captain of the Knights of Seiros... There was a woman at the monastery with whom Jeralt was quite close. At first, it seemed obvious this mystery woman was your mother. Alas, that cannot be the case. The timing is all wrong. As it was told to me, the woman in question passed away shortly before Jeralt left the monastery... Yet your birth occurred sometime later, while Jeralt was taking work as a mercenary. This, of course, presumes your age is accurately reported. If you were born sooner, well, the story would be quite different, would it not?",
        "For example, Jeralt never once spoke of his time serving as captain of the knights. That's quite a secret to keep for all those years. In the end, your old acquaintances had little definitive to say about either of you. However, they all agreed on one thing—your father, and yourself, were a strong pair. Warriors to be respected and feared. You, in particular. In fact, many came to know you as the Ashen Demon. They say you would destroy your enemies without a hint of emotion on your face. The mercenaries I spoke to revered you as a living legend of sorts.",
        "So, that is what I learned. And, I admit, it is barely more than I knew before. The next step in my research is to ask you blood for answers, and hope that it is more forthcoming than your past acquaintances.",
        "How are you doing, Professor? Would you care to join me for a cup of tea?",
        "It occurs to me that, whenever we chat, I have a tendency to pester you with my questions and theories about your history... It seems only fair to speak on the topic of myself for once. And perhaps you might feel more positive inclined toward my research, if I shared my own story.",
        "Well... I suppose I should begin at the beginning, eh? I was born into a noble house of the Empire. Not a large house, mind you. But noble all the same. Our land holdings were small, but our bloodline was quite strong. So, you can imagine, there were many of us in the family who carried the power of Crests. I, myself, bear a minor Crest. Our family's abundance of Crests may be part of the reason I've been interested in the topic since I was just a boy. I dedicated myself to my studies, and after years of effort, I became lead Crest scholar at the Empire's largest research institution.",
        "So I came to Garreg Mach and devoted myself to my research during my time as a professor. My progress is slow, but with each revelation, I move ever closer to the answers I have sought for decades. Your cooperation as the bearer of the Crest of Flames ensures my research will continue to advance. In fact, it may bring me ever closer to the goal of uncovering everything there is to know about Crests. I do hope you shall continue helping me advance in this field of study.",
        "Together, we will solve the mystery of your Crest of Flames, and our world will be the better for it. Shall we proceed? My lab instruments are fully prepared. I have a great number of tests I am excited to carry out... No, no, don't worry. They won't hurt a bit.",
        "Which means that there are some elements of your power that cannot be explained by current theory. Although this may lead to a discovery that alters the very fabric of Crest research... Oh, pardon me, Professor. I became lost in thought and I do tend to ramble. I suggest we call it a day. Do you concur?",
        "That said, perhaps we should discuss things unrelated to Crests from time to time. Some sort of silly, light-hearted topic might be nice, eh?",
        "I'm not especially skilled at small talk, alas. Let me see... Perhaps we should discuss... Hmm... I know! Food! Not my strong suit, the culinary arts, but I do enjoy a good meal! Which kind of food do you prefer, Professor? Sweet or spicy?",
        "An old colleague of mine theorized that those who bear Crests favor sweet flavors over spicy. She suggested that the Crest exerts some manner of influence over... Oh, there I go again. How embarrassing. We were supposed to be avoiding talk of Crests, weren't we? Terrible habit of mine, finding a way to turn any conversation towards Crests. I really should find a way to stop that.",
        "That is kind of you, Professor, but it's all right. If you were to lose your patience with me, it could have an incalculable impact on my research. That sort of thing has happened in the past, you know. Back when I was still in the Empire... At first, any lady I was spending time with would titter and say she didn't mind if I talked about Crests. But, at some point, she would always become fed up and stop listening to what i had to say. In the end — invariably while I was particularly focused on my research — she would write to say we were done. You may be a man, but I still don't wish for you to grow tired of my company.",
        "Ah, Professor! Always a pleasure to see you. I wonder, might you have a moment to chat?",
        "Come now. You have no need to be on guard.",
        "I'd never cause you harm. You're far too valuable a specim— Well, that is to say, too valuable a member of the academy staff. Indeed, the further my Crest research progresses, the closer you come to learning the truth of your heritage. Is it not so? When I learned you bore the lost Crest—the very Crest of Flames itself!—I set about learning everything I could about your past. What was the origin of your bloodline? How have the events of your life been shaped by your lineage? I became somewhat obsessed, I must admit.",
        "Of course, I also contacted Jeralt and his mercenary friends. Your father does keep rather interesting company. I'm excited to share with you what I learned, but I do ask that you correct me if I am mistaken on any account. The story begins with Jeralt serving as captain of the Knights of Seiros... There was a woman at the monastery with whom Jeralt was quite close. At first, it seemed obvious this mystery woman was your mother. Alas, that cannot be the case. The timing is all wrong. As it was told to me, the woman in question passed away shortly before Jeralt left the monastery... Yet your birth occurred sometime later, while Jeralt was taking work as a mercenary. This, of course, presumes your age is accurately reported. If you were born sooner, well, the story would be quite different, would it not?",
        "For example, Jeralt never once spoke of his time serving as captain of the knights. That's quite a secret to keep for all those years. In the end, your old acquaintances had little definitive to say about either of you. However, they all agreed on one thing—your father, and yourself, were a strong pair. Warriors to be respected and feared. You, in particular. In fact, many came to know you as the Ashen Demon. They say you would destroy your enemies without a hint of emotion on your face. The mercenaries I spoke to revered you as a living legend of sorts.",
        "So, that is what I learned. And, I admit, it is barely more than I knew before. The next step in my research is to ask you blood for answers, and hope that it is more forthcoming than your past acquaintances.",
        "How are you doing, Professor? Would you care to join me for a cup of tea?",
        "It occurs to me that, whenever we chat, I have a tendency to pester you with my questions and theories about your history... It seems only fair to speak on the topic of myself for once. And perhaps you might feel more positive inclined toward my research, if I shared my own story.",
        "Well... I suppose I should begin at the beginning, eh? I was born into a noble house of the Empire. Not a large house, mind you. But noble all the same. Our land holdings were small, but our bloodline was quite strong. So, you can imagine, there were many of us in the family who carried the power of Crests. I, myself, bear a minor Crest. Our family's abundance of Crests may be part of the reason I've been interested in the topic since I was just a boy. I dedicated myself to my studies, and after years of effort, I became lead Crest scholar at the Empire's largest research institution.",
        "So I came to Garreg Mach and devoted myself to my research during my time as a professor. My progress is slow, but with each revelation, I move ever closer to the answers I have sought for decades. Your cooperation as the bearer of the Crest of Flames ensures my research will continue to advance. In fact, it may bring me ever closer to the goal of uncovering everything there is to know about Crests. I do hope you shall continue helping me advance in this field of study.",
        "Together, we will solve the mystery of your Crest of Flames, and our world will be the better for it. Shall we proceed? My lab instruments are fully prepared. I have a great number of tests I am excited to carry out... No, no, don't worry. They won't hurt a bit.",
        "Which means that there are some elements of your power that cannot be explained by current theory. Although this may lead to a discovery that alters the very fabric of Crest research... Oh, pardon me, Professor. I became lost in thought and I do tend to ramble. I suggest we call it a day. Do you concur?",
        "That said, perhaps we should discuss things unrelated to Crests from time to time. Some sort of silly, light-hearted topic might be nice, eh?",
        "I'm not especially skilled at small talk, alas. Let me see... Perhaps we should discuss... Hmm... I know! Food! Not my strong suit, the culinary arts, but I do enjoy a good meal! Which kind of food do you prefer, Professor? Sweet or spicy?",
        "An old colleague of mine theorized that those who bear Crests favor sweet flavors over spicy. She suggested that the Crest exerts some manner of influence over... Oh, there I go again. How embarrassing. We were supposed to be avoiding talk of Crests, weren't we? Terrible habit of mine, finding a way to turn any conversation towards Crests. I really should find a way to stop that.",
        "That is kind of you, Professor, but it's all right. If you were to lose your patience with me, it could have an incalculable impact on my research. That sort of thing has happened in the past, you know. Back when I was still in the Empire... At first, any lady I was spending time with would titter and say she didn't mind if I talked about Crests. But, at some point, she would always become fed up and stop listening to what i had to say. In the end — invariably while I was particularly focused on my research — she would write to say we were done. I will do everything I can to keep that from happening this time.",
        "So falls the curtain on our time of war. Though I suppose one can never say all is over and done... You have much still to do, and I have miles to go before I achieve my own dreams. We both have many hardships in store for us, don't you think?",
        "Indeed. Well, that talk aside, I have a bit of a proposition for you. I believe it is better to travel the path through life with someone else, rather than go forward alone. And you are indispensable to my research... No, thats not the full truth. Yes, you are indispensable to my research, but also to my life. Altogether, I mean. I haven't any idea how to treat a woman properly. And so, I've long thought I would spend my life alone. But then, well... I met you. And I want to share everything with you. If you happen to feel the same way, er, well, that is to say... Would you accept this ring?",
        "'''And in return... perhaps you would care to learn all there is to know about me. I've never been the subject of someone else's research before, but I am open to the prospect. I can think of no one more suitable for the task... than the woman I love. The future... Ah, I mean our future. It offers quite a lot to look forward to. I can't wait to see the results of this new undertaking.'''",
        "Hmm, what is on my agenda for this afternoon...",
        "Ah, it's you... Very well. I am quite busy, but if you are here to discuss my Crest research, I would be happy to oblige...",
        "Oh? I doubt if I have anything of particular interest to share.",
        "Certainly, that was an option. But I desired a better research environment. Treasures and holy artifacts reside here that cannot be examined by someone outside the church. I required access to those things, no matter the cost.",
        "What you say is true. I cannot deny that. Both paths have advantages and disadvantages.",
        "I don't know what you mean.",
        "I feel your suspicions of me are unwarranted. I haven't the time now, but perhaps I will tell you more if the opportunity arises.",
        "Ah, young Edelgard. This is your first time in this room, yes?",
        "True enough. But now you have come here by your own choice. Can I take that as an indication that you have come to trust me a little more?",
        "Tell me, what things might those be?",
        "With the world freed from the powers of Crests, Fódlan's system of nobility will collapse.",
        "Why should that have any effect on me? I am no longer a member of the nobility.",
        "I see... Ah, I think I finally understand why you've always seemed so unsure about me. You imagine your ambition might crush my dreams. I assure you, there is nothing to worry about. I support your plans, and your ideals, wholeheartedly. But at the same time, I also believe that the influence of Crests will not be so easily quelled. That is why I must continue to research them and unravel all the secrets they hold.",
        "Whatever for? I'm not bothered by you investigating my past.",
        "What happened... It was over 20 years ago. I suppose you had just barely been born, now that I think on it. My younger sister was afflicted by a disease of the heart and she met with an early death. It is easy to lay blame for such things. But I considered Crests themselves to be the root cause.",
        "As an up-and-coming Crest scholar at the time, I knew only despair. What was the use of my research if I could not even save my own sister?",
        "My sister is far from the only victim. Many noblemen have done the same to their own wives, and I despise them for it. So, my quest began. I would unlock the secrets of Crests, make them available to any who desired... If I achieved my goal, the nobility would be rendered obsolete, and my sister could finally rest peacefully. However, all these years later, I am still far from achieving my goal.",
        "Quite right. And that is why I have chosen to fight by your side. I cannot say what lies in your past, yet I have seen your ideals, and witnessed the power of your two Crests. I feel certain that you, too, are a victim of this world, just like my dear sister...",
        "I've made peace with my past. Now, I look only to the future. To the world we're fighting to create.",
        "But if you will allow it, there is one more thing I would like to say on the subject. When I look at you, I am reminded of my sister. And also of my own youth. Though I could not save my sister back then, I am...different now. I can support you and lend you my abilities. I will fight for your cause in whatever way you need.",
        "And in turn, I will do my best to earn the trust you have placed in me.",
        "Hubert, my boy. It's rather rare for the two of us to see one another with no one else around, isn't it?",
        "I was good friends with your father, you know. Perhaps this is fate, eh? Of course, when I left the Empire, I broke off my friendship with him...and, well, everyone else.",
        "Sharp words, Hubert. Contemptible though your father may be, he is still your father.",
        "I assume you're talking about the Insurrection of the Seven. At the time, I was already at Garreg Mach. I know nothing more than hearsay. That said, I found it hard to believe that Lord Vestra would challenge the emperor like that.",
        "In your father's defense, the emperor was attempting to take power from the Seven Houses. The emperor's reform was an attempt to concentrate power in the hands of the throne. The nobles...put a stop to that. Emperor Ionius lost the ensuing power struggle.",
        "You hope she can cease this never-ending conflict? That's quite a goal, Hubert...",
        "Your gratitude is wasted on me, Hubert. I choose this situation entirely because it benefits me. I could carry out my research anywhere, of course, but that is, as they say, beside the point.",
        "Hubert. There's something I want to tell you. Will you hear me out?",
        "It concerns your father.",
        "Oh, by all means, cover your ears and run out of the room. I'll still speak the words, for I feel that I must. Your father, the Marquis of Vestra—well rather, the former Marquis of Vestra—was a selfless man. He was practical and never sought power for the sake of power. In that respect, you and he are rather alike. Do you think such a man would so easily betray his emperor, even if led astray by the prime minister?",
        "Agreed. Facts are facts. The palace walls are stuffed with countless truths, all of them concealed by the stones and mortar of fact. I hoped you would have the capacity to see the unfettered truth. But I fear that where your father is concerned, your eyes may see only what you wish them to see.",
        "Feel free to ignore me. I know full well I have my own blind spots. It's just... I believe your father had something he was trying to protect. Bearing a stain on his honor, being purged by his own son... All in the name of protection. I speak from knowledge, as someone who failed to protect something I held dear.",
        "Ah, I can see the right of that. You have chosen your own path, Hubert. Continue protecting what you wish to protect, and I shall support you from the bottom of my heart.",
        "Ah, Linhardt. Reading as studiously as ever, I see. Anything to do with Crests?",
        "I didn't realize you were interested in fishing. What an unexpected discovery. I had heard that you were only interested in Crests, to the exclusion of all else. As it were, I had rather thought I could train you as my successor, should we get to know one another better.",
        "What?! Whatever for? don't tell me you believe fishing to be a more worthwhile pursuit!",
        "It is an unavoidable hardship, I admit. But the satisfaction of making a real breakthrough is second to none!",
        "Consider this, child. Luring fish from the depths pales in comparison to untangling the mysteries of a Crest. Why? It all comes down to purpose. Purpose, I say!",
        "Evidently, you do not. You must have something to work toward in life. The ultimate goal of fishing is to eat the fish. The goal of solving the mysteries of Crests is... Well, you must find that for yourself. What do you hope to uncover once everything is finally explained? What motivates you to keep digging deeper?",
        "Linhardt! Of course.",
        "Hmm... Well, no need to panic. Sometimes, a goal can reveal itself to you without warning.",
        "Oh, mine? I want to create a world where everyone can access the power of Crests. Where no one has to suffer from having or not having that power.",
        "Ah, you may be right. But at least then, we wouldn't be the only ones taking such pains. The more people who have Crests, the more people who will do research. And with more students, the research will progress far faster than it is today. That also means there would be less of the back-and-forth you don't have the energy for, which should make you happy.",
        "Does that still do nothing to pique your interest?",
        "Hmm, so you at least understand that much. That is why I do research. If someone's going to see results someday, then I want it to be me. That's a thought that keeps me moving forward, even when it is difficult to do so.",
        "Are you saying you would agree to study Crests with your old professor?",
        "As it were, I feel very much like someone who's made a catch! But the future shall hold even greater things than that. That's a promise.",
        "Ahhh. Time to relax.",
        "Of course, of course, Miss Dorothea. Whatever is on your mind?",
        "Indeed, I was a noble once. Why are you so curious about that?",
        "I threw nothing away, child. In fact, by stepping away from its trappings, in my heart, I feel closer than ever to the true meaning of nobility.",
        "Consider this. At its inception, the concept of nobility assumed that the greatest among the populace would rise to power. In my mind, I believe that those who value knowledge, those who strive for more, and wish to protect and guide their fellow man. However, in practice, nobility often serves to keep those deemed commoners down, segregated from those who, by chance, were born to a noble family. That is one of the reasons I decided to leave that nonsense behind, and dedicate myself to the study of Crests. Though I have abandoned my position, in my mind, it was to pursue what I consider to be a truly noble pursuit... That of knowledge.",
        "Pardon?",
        "Ah! Well, I'm quite pleased to hear you say so.",
        "Hello, Miss Dorothea. There is something I would like to ask you, should you have a moment.",
        "Ah, it's just some rumor I heard. About your prejudice against the nobility. You remember when you came to me before, and we talked about how I used to be a noble? I was just wondering what your aim was.",
        "I see. But nobles obsessed with their status... You must have had some terrible experience in the past. Ah... My apologies. That was rather presumptuous.",
        "My goodness... From an orphan to a renowned songstress. That is quite a life you have led, Miss Dorothea.",
        "I see...",
        "Oh?",
        "You have my most heartfelt of apologies, Dorothea. I am afraid my curiosity has opened old wounds. Sadly, it is undeniable that the nobility is full of such terrible people. Perhaps... even myself...",
        "Oh, it is nothing. Just lost in a memory of my own. Just know that I will do my part to ensure that you always know kindness in this world.",
        "Dorothea, my dear, you must be tired from the extended fighting. May I get you anything?",
        "You don't appear fine. Make sure not to overexert yourself. The war is not yours alone to fight. You have friends to rely on. We are here for you, always.",
        "Well, of course. You're like a...",
        "N-nothing... You're a very good friend. That's all. And once the war is over, I want to be sure you have a pleasant life.",
        "Ahead of myself? No, I don't think so.",
        "Huh? A ring you mean? Well, I...",
        "Oh my! That's what you were thinking! I've misled you. I see now I phrased things all... Just all wrong. I had no other intentions, I swear. I'm sorry. Please forgive me.",
        "I... But I haven't...",
        "Teasing. Ah. Well, of course.",
        "Why, it sounds lovely. Quite lovely.",
        "And that should explain it. Did you understand all of that, young Annette?",
        "Questioning something like this is proof that your understanding has grown. Most impressive. Sit there, and I'll put this on the blackboard so you may copy it into your notes for later study.",
        "I believe that should explain everything, yes? Any further questions?",
        "Not at all! Not at all. Your intellectual curiosity is marvelous to see. And you have a top-notch character. Keep on as you are, and I sense a bright future for you. Seeing you continue to grow and succeed is more than a humble professor, like myself, deserves.",
        "If only your friends would learn from your example. Yes, a classroom full of attentive, studious pupils would be quite refreshing after all these years. Have a good evening, Miss Annette. And do not hesitate to ask any other questions.",
        "Wait! You'll trip if you leave like that!",
        "Thank you for volunteering to clean this room, Miss Annette. Most appreciated.",
        "In that case, I have nothing to worry about. Do make sure you get the bookshelf as well. Be thorough.",
        "Dirt always lurks in the places you can't see. Best of luck on your hunt!",
        "Miss Annette! Please stop jumping on the stool. You'll tumble down and crack your skull.",
        "Miss Annette! Are you all right? Can you stand?",
        "What a blessing neither the books nor yourself came to any harm. Here, I'll help you clear them up. Oh, my... The inside of this bookshelf is quite filthy.",
        "And we found it thanks to all the books falling. Every cloud has a dusty lining.",
        "Agreed! Shall we endeavor to get rid of it together?",
        "Steady. Don't go leaping about in your enthusiasm!",
        "Miss Annette! If you carry on like that, I daresay the bookshelf shall give out in a few moment's time.",
        "I understand. I had noticed it myself, actually, and was just on my way to get a cloth for it. How about you leave this part to me?",
        "No need to thank me. I must admit, I'm rather impressed by your keen dust-spotting eye.",
        "I'm quite the same. How anyone can abide dust—even hidden dust — well, I can't grasp the idea.",
        "We do seem to be similar in a number of ways, yes? So I have a spot of advice for you, if you don't mind.",
        "Next time you identify a dusty patch in an inaccessible location...please send for me?",
        "Nonsense! I'm keen to avoid a repeat performance of the Tragedy of Miss Annette and the Books.",
        "Indeed. I would never forgive myself if you managed to a pull a whole bookcase over on yourself.",
        "Nonsense. I told you to come to me anytime you needed help. Nothing to be sorry about at all. So what can I help you with today, Miss Annette?",
        "Perhaps not related to your studies, but I sense something else troubles you.",
        "Your marks at the school of sorcery and the military academy were exceptional. You have many, many options. The only trouble I see for you is in picking which one to chase.",
        "Lost, hmm? It seems to me that you're just lacking in decisiveness.",
        "For example, I've already been considering my own future, once this war ends at last. I think I might leave Garreg Mach. I've spent a great deal of time researching Crests, both in the Empire and at the monastery. Fódlan is large, with much to see and learn. It would be a shame to spend all my years in too few places.",
        "That's the question, isn't it? I've considered the school of sorcery in Fhirdiad. It would be good to get a new viewpoint on Crest research. There are certainly discoveries to be made. However, new places are daunting. Yet I'd have no complaints if I had a former student as an apprentice. Say, a former student who is brimming with curiosity, talented at magic, and as tidy as myself?",
        "I was merely expressing a possibility. It all depends on your own feelings and interests.",
        "Those are but minor side notes compared to your wonderful qualities, Miss Annette. You are serious in your studies and possessing of excellent character. You surpass even myself.",
        "I truly feel you could, yes. You could accompany me to Fhirdiad. I think that would be most splendid, don't you?",
        "First, though, we must put an end to this war. The future cannot begin until we achieve victory.",
        "I know you will, Miss Annette. You have my full support.",
        "Oh! My apologies, child. I was trying to remain inconspicuous, not wanting to interrupt.",
        "Well, I must apologize. In the future, I shall do my staring out in the open.",
        "I have no desire to disturb not to disquiet you... But you are a most exquisite subject for my Crest research. And you understand that the foundation of all research is observation.",
        "In return, I will keep your secret. I have not spoken a word of your twin Crests, not even to the church. If they knew I was withholding such valuable information, I might be branded a traitor. But such matters are trivial to the future of Crestology!",
        "Pardon my excitement. I simply cannot let the opportunity to study such a miraculous subject go to waste.",
        "I hope one day you will share more about your tragic origins, whenever you have the time to recount it. Your tale may contain valuable information...",
        "Ah, I fear I may have made a misstep. I have no desire to trouble her, yet my research...",
        "That will do nicely, Lysithea. I'm sorry to trouble you with these chores.",
        "The elderly? I'm only—Never mind. How have you been feeling as of late? Anything worth mentioning?",
        "You seem to be maturing remarkably. No doubt your well-being is due to the positive influence of your twin Crests working in tandem.",
        "I may ignore your assaults on my age, but I will not allow unfettered attacks upon my research. What makes you think it's lacking? Surely you do not deny that your Crest-related abilities exceed those of your peers. You are so far ahead of the others... Even the combined effects of the twin Crests you bear do not fully account for that discrepancy.",
        "Of course I am aware that you are a hardworking student, but...",
        "Is the ability to expend such incredible efforts, to be so focused, and driven... Is that not a form of talent?",
        "I see... But what drives you to such lengths?",
        "Little time?",
        "I... I cannot... Please understand... I had no idea.",
        "Lysithea. So that is why you are...",
        "Ah, Lysithea. Thank you for coming. First, I ask that you allow me to apologize. I fear I hurt you with my insensitive words. I have failed you, not as a researcher, but as a human being.",
        "Please, Lysithea, a moment more? I did not call you here simply to apologize. I told you once that you were an exquisite subject for my Crest research. Why? Because there are no records of any other person ever having borne two Crests.",
        "We cannot say anything for certain about the makeup of your body. Therefore, it seems hasty to conclude that overcoming your shortened lifespan is an impossible feat.",
        "Lysithea. What is my field of study?",
        "Indeed. And the goal of my field is to unravel every single mystery Crests might conceal. Someday, I even hope to devise a means to bestow a Crest upon any who desires one.",
        "Because I despise this world in which the presence or absence of a Crest can determine a person's worth.",
        "However, if artificially implanting a Crest causes too great a toll on the subject, it would be useless. As such, reducing the strain of Crest on the human body is one of my research goals. Understanding how to implant a Crest might also lead to the knowledge of how to remove them, yes?",
        "What I am trying to tell you is... The question of whether your lifespan can be restored is entirely within the scope of my research.",
        "It is difficult to say for sure. But as long as the possibility exists, I will continue to seek it. Lysithea, let me ask you once more. Will you assist me in my research?",
        "Ah, is that right?! Perhaps you would even like to begin studying Crestology yourself? I think you would make a fantastic apprentice. A life devoted to research is a noble life, you know!",
        "I will hold you to those words! Ah, I see a fine future ahead of us!",
        "Finished with your training, Miss Marianne?",
        "You have merely completed the exercises assigned to you, yes? Nothing more? Or am I wrong?",
        "No, no please. You've done as you were asked. Quite solid work, child. I simply wish...to ask a question. You posses a Crest, do you not?",
        "When you entered the Officers Academy, your father submitted a request to the monastery...as well as a significant donation. Your father asked that your Crest not be confirmed. Under any circumstances. At first, I thought he did not want the world to know that his daughter bore no Crest. In your father's position as a newly-minted noble, it would be most advantageous for his daughter to possess a Crest, you see. However, I am now certain I was wrong. I believe you do, in fact, possess a Crest of some sort.",
        "I have been called the \"Father of Crestology,\" which is a bit of an ostentatious title, I admit. However... A brief period of observation allows me to hazard a usually accurate guess as to whether a body houses a Crest or not. With the knowledge of your father's actions, and my own observations, I come to you with a warning... As a Crest-bearer, you are guaranteed to have certain talents. It is prudent to study your Crest diligently to ensure the safe mastery of these talents, whatever they may prove to be.",
        "Oh yes, you do. No matter how hard you may try to hide it, my sight is keener than that. And what I see, others will eventually notice as well. Those who hold power must wield it in the service of their fellow man, Miss Marianne. I believe that is true whether you are peasant or noble, and doubly true, I would say, for those with Crest. Or do you think I'm wrong?",
        "On principle alone, it is a waste to allow a rare talent to remain dormant. I would very much like to advise you, to aid your understanding of your Crest. Will you accept my offer?",
        "That is regrettable... A veritable tragedy, Miss Marianne.",
        "Miss Marianne, hello. Do pardon the mess. Please, have a seat.",
        "I have been puzzling over why your father would wish to conceal your Crest... And I have arrived at a conclusion. Would you like to hear it?",
        "Ah. Fair enough. Then I will keep it to myself. However, if my theory is correct... Well, then it is only natural for you, and your father, to try keeping your Crest a secret. That said, I feel I would be remiss if I didn't point out that I consider this decision a most grievous error.",
        "Crests never manifest in someone unfit to bear them. Which means, Miss Marianne, you have the ability to make the most of your Crest because it is, by definition, your Crest.",
        "But it can be of service to you, and, I would venture to suggest, to the world at large.",
        "Ah, that's right. I have heard that you were adopted. Did one of your birth parents also have that Crest?",
        "Then that Crest is evidence that you are your true father's daughter. Concealing it—hiding that truth from the world—is denying your true parentage, is it not?",
        "I'm not suggesting that you flaunt your Crest. That would be highly unnecessary. Possibly even dangerous. I simply wish you to accept who you are.",
        "Accept the Crest, and allow its power to come forward, then it will open itself to you. Whatever the Crest may be, whatever its origin, or its nature, it can serve you. It is yours to command however you wish.",
        "Nobody can decide how to use your Crest, Miss Marianne. That choice is yours alone.",
        "Why, hello, Miss Marianne. A visit from you is a rare pleasure indeed.",
        "Oh, how intriguing. Whatever is on your mind?",
        "What a splendid thought. Quite exceptional! May I ask how it is you've reached this conclusion? I admit, I did not imagine my words would do much to sway you.",
        "Well, indeed! So it seems my words resonated with you after all.",
        "That's it! Exactly right, Miss Marianne!",
        "I have every confidence that you will succeed at drawing out your Crest's full strength. And I intend to help you at every step. If you'll have my help, that is.",
        "Well, uh... Say, are those Crest documents? Ah, Seteth! Have you finally decided to cooperate with my research?!",
        "I am quite tempted by the offer, but your cooperation would be of much greater value. Your Crest, the Major Crest of Cichol, is so rare. As far as I am aware, Seteth, you are the only person ever confirmed to bear that particular Crest. How did you come to possess it?",
        "Oh, please. That thin explanation could never discourage me! You must understand, I will dig until I find the truth. No matter how long it takes.",
        "That is for me alone to decide. And even if you are correct... That confirmation itself would be a valuable discovery. Such is the way of research, yes?",
        "Let's not do anything hasty now! I will leave you alone—for now—but I am taking these documents with me! Once I complete my research on these papers, it'll be your turn, Seteth. I will learn the truth of your Crest!",
        "Perhaps his stubborn nature is one of the effects of his Crest? Now that would be an interesting discovery... The first stage of my research will be to decipher his personality...",
        "Good day to you, Seteth.",
        "No, no. I thought we might speak of something else for a change.",
        "Indeed. I am quite fond of conversation, even just for the sake of conversation. Just listen to an old man's worries, eh?",
        "Perhaps it's due to my age, but I've been troubled by lower back pain lately. Right now I'm in the process of finding a good way to treat it.",
        "An excellent suggestion. Yes, I'm sure she will be able to help me with the pain itself, but... Doesn't it make you nervous to rely on Manuela? I do not mind asking her about the pain itself, but...",
        "Oh, nothing. I'm only lamenting the fact that I am getting old. It is a pastime I'm not sure I enjoy...Yet I can't help but notice time hasn't taken such a toll on you.",
        "Is that right? But then, that doesn't explain your sister...",
        "Your sister, Flayn, was born around the time I came to the monastery from the Empire, yes? In all that time, I never knew you to pay her a visit or to write her letters... Yet, somehow, the two of you seem very close. Like a family who has spent years together. Could this not suggest a different interpretation? Perhaps, like you, she has—",
        "Calm down, Seteth. I have no intentions of approaching Flayn.",
        "You have my word as a scholar, and as a man. I do apologize for using your sister's name in that way.",
        "You promised me just now... \"Investigate me all you wish,\" you said. \"I will even cooperate,\" you said. Do you deny it? Those words were all I needed to hear. Now I have no cause to approach your sister.",
        "I'll let that slight go, now that I have your cooperation.",
        "Oh, Seteth. Searching for the truth is what I do. And I will find it. I promise you that.",
        "Manuela... Isn't it a bit rude to sight at someone the moment you see them enter the room?",
        "Goodness. You're unusually irritable today. Don't you imagine your attitude a bit...excessive? You snap at everything thing, your ill mood on display for one and all. It saddens me to see such behavior from one who should be setting a good example for the younger generation.",
        "I fail to understand how my birth is relevant to the topic at hand. I was merely trying to say that as a fellow adult...",
        "I don't know what to say to you, Manuela. I was only speaking out of honest concern.",
        "Don't be so childish! You are so sensitive to ill will from others, yet you let your own emotions run wild. Why is it you cannot keep a handle on yourself?",
        "I will not stand for this insolence. It is high time someone taught you...",
        "Absolutely insufferable!",
        "Manuela. I would...like to apologize. The other day, I said some things to you that I am, well, not proud of in the least.",
        "No, please, pay it no mind. Actually, I'm thankful for what you said during our conflict.",
        "Yes. You made me realize that I have a somewhat meddlesome nature. Thanks to you, I believe I've found an area in which I can improve myself.",
        "Well, that's good to hear. It seems this wasn't a fruitless clash for either of us.",
        "Don't you wonder, though, just how many times we've had this same argument? We do always seem to be at one another's throats before we even realize it. I don't know how we manage to keep it up.",
        "Well, it's just... You don't smile like that very often. But when you do, it is quite charming. Perhaps your struggles in love are due to your reliance on false affection instead of your more natural charms.",
        "What? I Manuela. As your friend, I was only trying to give you a useful bit of advice!",
        "There it is! Manuela begins to protest even when she knows the fault lies with herself! I tell you...",
        "You presuppose I am only thinking of you!",
        "It can hardly be helped. You and I seem opposed to none another on a, let's call it, an instinctual level.",
        "Agreed, yes. It does feel as if we have fallen into a rather tiresome bit of repetition.",
        "Hmm... Here's a thought. Couples who are similar to one another, share the same views and all that, they're pretty successful.",
        "Hmm. Don't be so hasty to dismiss your own hypothesis! For instance... I am apt at cleaning, but have no talent for cookery. Whilst you loathe cleaning, but are a splendid chef. Would it not be an easier life if, rather than struggle through our weaker areas, we divided the work?",
        "Indeed. If we combine our abilities, housework would be conquered and dinner rendered delicious. There are other ways we could find to support one another, I would imagine. We might make a better pair than you think. You and I, together.",
        "I I did no such thing! You were the one who started discussion on the topic in the first place!",
        "You were agreeing with me! If you have objections, then let's hear them!",
        "Why, it's Gilbert. Training on a day off? That man will never change...nor rest, apparently. Is there any need to be so diligent when nobody is watching? Ah well, at least I can bear witness.",
        "Ah, you noticed me. No, no, not at all. I was simply observing. I apologize for disturbing you.",
        "Oh, well, I watch because I find it quite interesting. Your movements are most refined, with no unnecessary motions. Elegant is the word, I think. I find it quite satisfying to observe. In fact, I might say I was mesmerized.",
        "If only you showed a bit more emotion on your face, just to sell the rest of it. You come off a bit tense.",
        "Oh, I know well how difficult training can be. But in your case, it's as though you're punishing yourself.",
        "No, no, what do I know of your training? My criticism was, perhaps, unnecessary. Still, I do feel you are too hard on yourself. Would it not be easier to live a little more freely? Find something that makes you happy and embrace it wholeheartedly. It would do you a world of good.",
        "Not permitted? I think the only one not permitting you joy, dear Gilbert, is yourself.",
        "Your face looks stiff as ever, Gilbert.",
        "Understood. And I suppose seeing you train with an expression of glee would be rather unsettling. Still, you've finished for the day, yes? Would you join me for tea, and perhaps a chat?",
        "Certainly. Ask away. I'll answer whatever is within my power to do so.",
        "Whatever are you talking about? I don't speak to you out of some ulterior motive. Certainly, I have previously approached others because of my research interests... That is not the case here. I merely wish to get to know you.",
        "Yes! It is not often I have the opportunity to find friends my own age, you see.",
        "Well, regardless of how you feel, speaking for myself, I already consider you something of a friend. You must have heard of my tenacity. It will prove easier if you accept my offer of friendship now!",
        "Was that a laugh? A rarity for you, Gilbert. Can I take that to mean we are friends indeed?",
        "Well, I am honored. Then, as a first step, I would like it if we could find a common interest. A hobby to engage in. Something the younger folk would not appreciate, and may even be irritated by.",
        "Another laugh! I must say we may make a better duo than I first expected.",
        "My, look at the time. I really should retire for the evening.",
        "Oh my! Who's there? Alois? Well now, wherever did you come from?",
        "Came through the— Try doing so with a bit less volume in the future. Now then, why are you visiting at such a late hour?",
        "You're a knight, Alois. Why would I teach you magic?",
        "Perhaps you should ask one of your friends already trained in the magical arts. I am tired and would very much like to turn in for the evening.",
        "Ah... you heard about that, did you? I'm afraid that was simply for the purpose of my experiments. I had no intention of teaching anyone. Anyway, as I said, I am off to bed. Good night, Alois.",
        "Ah, maybe I'm just a fool who goes soft in the face of someone's hunger for knowledge... I will help you. I cannot teach you any spells, but I can do my best to try and improve your magical affinity. Will that be enough?",
        "Very well. We will see what we can do. For now, I am off to bed, and you should do the same.",
        "To be blunt, you are still struggling more than I would expect.",
        "How does someone remain so upbeat when they are accomplishing, well, absolutely nothing?",
        "Just jabbering to myself. Pay me no mind.",
        "Well, if I'm completely honest, you're less of a student and more of an experiment. You have no Crest, but you might be able to learn magic... despite our early results. And the potential magical ability of those who lack a Crest is precisely what I hope to research.",
        "When studying Crests, it is also important to understand the effects of their absence. After all, the very reason for all of my research is to grant the power of a Crest to anyone who desires it. If it is in fact possible to increase the magical potential of people lacking a Crest, then I find myself one step closer to my goal. Hence my experiments with you are quite valuable to my research.",
        "Could you express your enthusiasm more... quietly? And if at any point you wish to discontinue...",
        "No. Shouts and screams are detrimental to scholarly research, and to my ears.",
        "Alois... Oh, forget it. That man never slows down. But I suppose I can appreciate why some are drawn to his... exuberance."

        "Hello, Professor. You seem to be in good health.",
        "Hm. Doesn't seem intimidated.",
        "No, not at all. It's just that I find myself a little concerned for your well-being. You see, Lady Edelgard has taken something of an interest in you.",
        "There is something you need to understand about the role I play here. One of my many duties is to determine potential advantages and potential threats to Her Highness. If you prove yourself useful to Lady Edelgard, then all will be well. If you pose a threat...I shall have to dispose of you.",
        "Yes. This is no joke. While I may be a student here, I am her servant first and foremost. Therefore, if an untimely demise is not to your liking, you would do well to demonstrate your utility with all haste. I should warn you that I am far less compromising than Lady Edelgard. Do not be at ease merely because you stand in her good graces for the time being.",
        "My family, House Vestra, has been sworn to House Hresvelg for generations. Since the dawn of the Empire, we have worked to protect the emperor by any means necessary—both in the open and in the shadows. If you incur our wrath, you will see just what I mean.",
        "It seems I am discovered. I suppose that means assassination is out of the question. At least for now.",
        "Lady Edelgard certainly took interest in a difficult one this time.",
        "I suppose that question does warrant a response, considering it may mean your life. The answer requires me to explain some of the complex internal politics of the Empire. Are you familiar with Volkhard von Arundel? He is Lady Edelgard's uncle. You may also know him as Lord Arundel, the Empire's Regent. Many years ago, he took Her Majesty and fled to the Kingdom of Faerghus. Then, after a time, he returned to seize power. Joining forces with Prime Minister Aegir and my father, Lord Arundel rendered Emperor Ionius IX...politically impotent. Lady Edelgard is Ionius IX's daughter. I cannot begin to fathom the depth of her sadness at his betrayal. I see something of Lord Arundel in you... When I look at you, I feel I can almost see a second self lurking beneath the surface. It is as if you are in constant dialogue with something inside your heart—something with desires very different from your own. Does that description feel familiar to you at all?",
        "Because to me you seem unpredictable. As though you could turn traitor at any moment.",
        "The more I learn about you, the less I like. I had thought you might be of some use to Lady Edelgard. But now I am beginning to think you may, through no fault of your own, present too great a risk. I hope you will prove me wrong, Professor. I would hate for this to come to bloodshed.",
        "Nice place, isn't it, Professor? Standing here, you can almost feel the goddess's absence. Discounting what dwells within you, of course. Do you think some punishment would rain down from the sky if this monastery were to be destroyed? Of course not. Even if the so-called Immaculate One came back here for revenge... That would only be the result of this war, not the work of a deity.",
        "If it is between love and hate, then I would choose the latter. The goddess failed to properly govern this world. That is why it is necessary for Lady Edelgard to become the supreme leader of Fódlan. Those with power must use it wisely. Is that not a teaching of the Church of Seiros? It's absurd to preach to others what you cannot practice yourself.",
        "That is not the case for inhuman creatures with lifespans well beyond our own. We must fight to preserve what makes us human. You are the one closest to the enemy. I wonder if you will be able to maintain your humanity to the end.",
        "Heh. I've already dedicated my life to Lady Edelgard. To throw my lot in with you is inconceivable. But if I had two lives to give... I might devote one of them to you. Not as master and servant, but as equal partners.",

        "You've kept me waiting. Where have you been? The war may be over, but matters of the government, diplomacy, and justice remain to be dealt with. There is one problem in particular that must be sorted first, however.",
        "You. Rather... you and me. '''' To think, I had rehearsed a long preamble. Now, when it matters, it's all vanished from memory as suddenly as the morning dew. To the point, then. I... love you. In fact, I wish to marry you.",
        "I've already spoken to Her Majesty about this. She told me to follow my heart. She seems to prefer that you be with me rather than some dubious individual. So, you could say that we have her blessing.",

        "I cannot believe I'm saying this. I am truly happy.",
        "I am afraid you've outdone me. I've brought no such token. Not much of a suitor, am I? I've never done well with gifts or flattery. Protecting you is easy. But to be a good husband...",
        "Of course such a thing doesn't bother you. I hope I can support you with the same tenacity. Thank you for doing me this honor. ''''",
        "'''I once thought that killing you would be a great challenge, but... The real difficulty was declaring my love.'''",
        "A more tedious path? Inconsequential and spoiled rotten, like so many other nobles? Never. My duty to you is no mere obligation. I chose this. I had thought that would be obvious to you.",
        "Such a life may have had its appeal. I thought I'd left my years of carefree innocence behind me. But I cannot deny that I find myself enjoying my time at the monastery.",
        "That enjoyment, however, is only thanks to you. Standing by your side is all that truly matters to me.",
        "Please leave the violence to me. A leader must be seen as pure. Above the fray. Allow me to paint the path that lies before you red with the blood of your enemies. I will do it gladly.",
        "From your perfect memory, Lady Edelgard, I expect nothing short of the utmost precision. Do go on.",
        "Forgive me. I suppose I must have been six at the time. I have no recollection of it. My earliest memory of you is of when you were injured. I recall being scolded most sternly by my father. \"You are Lady Edelgard's servant!\" he said. \"You must protect her with your life!\"",
        "Indeed. After that, I made certain to accompany you wherever you went. That is, until...the incident.",
        "The sensation of loss that overcame me on that day defies all description. It was as horrific as if I'd lost all my limbs. I left the city in a mad rush to rescue you. My father sent soldiers to capture me. I fought them off for three days, but they did finally manage it. Of course, I was only ten. I never would've reached Fhirdiad.",
        "It wasn't important.",
        "Respectfully, I decline.",
        "Speaking of your orders, there was a task you gave me earlier which I have yet to carry out. Excuse me.",
        "...And that concludes my report.",
        "I have told you before. There are secrets even I am unwilling to share.",
        "I fear you have misunderstood me, Your Majesty. It is true that I am officially your minister, but such titles are of little significance to me. I serve you purely out of personal devotion. Perhaps there was a time when I served the Imperial line due to my duty as a member of House Vestra. But since you returned from the Kingdom...my loyalty has been to you alone.",
        "Correct. If you prefer to treat this formally, then charge me with a crime. I will gladly offer up my neck to the executioner.",
        "In that case, Lady Edelgard, I ask you to turn a blind eye to my secrets. They are trifles, beneath your notice. Best I handle them alone. You should focus on the path ahead of you. The scarlet path I have carefully prepared. Whether that path is red with blood is not something you need trouble yourself over.",
        "... Very well. You have me beaten. I will tell you as much as I am able. From the assassins I've eliminated, to the gold I've spent on bribes...to the identity of the one I love.",
        "Yes. That is the one secret I had particularly hoped to keep from you.",
        "It is you, Lady Edelgard. Did you ever really doubt?",
        "Hahaha.",
        "This again.",
        "Maybe you would be more perceptive if your mind were less burdened by sedition.",
        "Yes, I heard. A new way to prove how superior you are to Lady Edelgard. She is not your rival, Ferdinand. She is above you. A noble, like you, ought to know his place.",
        "Your nonsense is tiresome, so I hope this will be the last time I have to remind you. Lady Edelgard is the Imperial princess. You are merely the prime minister's son.",
        "Does the river of filth pouring out of your mouth ever stop flowing? Your obsession with all things superficial is disgusting. It's no use. You're hopeless. I'll take my leave.",
        "Show them this letter. Threaten them. Do what you must. Now, go.",
        "I suppose there's no denying it.",
        "Explicitly forbade me to send it. Yes, I know.",
        "Unwaveringly. All that I do, I do for her. I seem to recall you expressing a similar sentiment. It is our role to guide her when she is on the wrong course of action. Is that not what you said?",
        "The point is the same. Lady Edelgard's best interests are served, whether she knows it or not. She needs not trouble herself with the mundane details of my actions. Only results matter.",
        "Perhaps your advice is simply useless, then.",
        "Listen to yourself. If I do as Lady Edelgard requires, then you tell me to be more independent. But if I tread my own path, I am misguided! I suppose the fault is mine for expecting any useful advice to come out of your mouth. Heh.",
        "It's strange. I never thought you and I would be able to sit together and drink tea like this.",
        "Your knowledge is impressive. Although I should expect nothing less from a noble, I suppose. Lady Edelgard surpasses you in nearly every respect. But I think, when it comes to positivity, you may actually exceed her.",
        "In a way, it is merely a mask for your tactlessness. But even so, your relentless optimism... Well. Suffice it to say that it is your best quality.",
        "You are constantly striving to grow as a person. To seek new knowledge. To push new limits. When others get distracted or abandon their path, you never yield. In that aspect, at least, I think you are unmatched.",
        "It was only a compliment. There's no need for such dramatic exaggeration.",
        "I do my best to analyze others without emotion. Even if I find you to be a contemptible degenerate, I can still evaluate your abilities in an impartial way.",
        "Heh. You actually understand.",
        "In the very unlikely event that there is a next time, I promise to put it in writing.",
        "Hello, Ferdinand. Wait—that aroma...",
        "Why did you buy coffee? You said you don't care for it.",
        "Rather harsh. What are you doing with it, then?",
        "It is indeed. Keen eyes.",
        "Before I answer that, I would like to know what you are doing with the coffee.",
        "Is it a gift? Perhaps for someone you fancy?",
        "Hm. Who is the unlucky— Did you say for me?! This coffee is a gift for me? Have I heard you correctly?",
        "I should decline.",
        "The thought of receiving a gift from you, unbidden and unreciprocated, fills me with revulsion. Therefore...accept this tea. As a gift. From me.",
        "That would be difficult to do, since I bought it with you in mind.",
        "That is what I said.",
        "Hahaha.",
        "Very well. But tea is not what I will be drinking.",
        "Then I will prepare the tea.",
        "Linhardt. Here again, I see.",
        "Now is exactly the time. Lady Edelgard requests your presence. Come. The lecture is about to start.",
        "While your passion may be admirable, it is sadly misdirected. This matter takes priority. Return to your hobby when your duty is done.",
        "The Empire requires you to be useful now. I should think you would want the same. You have an almost unparalleled intellect. A singular focus. An unfettered imagination. In truth, you have talents that many, including myself, will never have the privilege of possessing.",
        "Let me finish. I haven't an ounce of respect for the cause you have chosen to waste your talents on. Which changes frequently, I might add, with no rhyme, reason, or results. Learn to apply yourself to something constructive. You may still have a bright future.",
        "That is unacceptable. Even for a nobleman. Her Highness will soon ascend the throne. She is attempting to deal with such noble privilege head on.",
        "Pathetic. Keep to your books, then. Good-bye, Linhardt.",
        "I can't believe it. How can I show my face to Lady Edelgard after this?",
        "As much as it pains me to say it, you're right. But to be looked after—ugh. By you, of all people. That might be the worst part of this. I don't know how to feel, to be honest. So for now, let's pretend I thanked you.",
        "You would have in a heartbeat if anyone else had been around.",
        "If that were the sort of man you truly were, we could never be friends.",
        "Shame you're so reluctant to do any real work. You're actually pretty good at this. Made sure I was comfortable. Checked carefully for injuries. Even carried me here yourself. If only you'd apply that knowledge of yours so proactively and thoroughly all the time... You'd be a tremendous asset to the Empire.",
        "Maybe that's true. But even if it is, it's still just a fancy way to say you let others do all the work. Consider me unconvinced.",
        "Fine.",
        "I watched you training earlier. Pitiful display.",
        "You yell before every move.",
        "Stupid habit. If you value your life, you'll break it.",
        "As a matter of fact, I do. If it was only your own idiotic life at stake, I wouldn't bother saying anything. But it's not. Your foolishness hurts everyone.",
        "Suppose you were to shout on the battlefield as you did in your training today. It is very likely the enemy could anticipate your next move based on your insipid blather. And what if your allies are startled by your outburst, and fumble with their weapons as a result? This is not to mention the obvious fact that you would utterly botch any covert operation.",
        "Whatever habits you develop in training, you will reproduce on the battlefield. Combat is tense and frantic. You will default to your training whether you mean to or not.",
        "You were rather quiet in the last battle, Caspar. Not a single war cry to be heard. It was almost as if you weren't even there.",
        "Yes, I was. And at the time, you seemed intent on ignoring my advice.",
        "All on your own, huh? It was a bad decision. Being too quiet on the battlefield is extremely dangerous.",
        "Having seen you fight in silence, I have no choice but to accept the truth that your shouting is vital.",
        "We've all grown used to the way you fight. Your battle cries help morale. And your instructions rise above the din of battle. I would go so far as to say that the soldiers under your command would be lost without the guidance of your booming voice.",
        "You inspire people. The benefits of your shouting outweigh the risks.",
        "Something wrong?",
        "Don't get too excited. You'll be ambushed again.",
        "That might have been the wrong approach. Ah, well. No cure for stupidity. I suppose I'll just have to rein him in myself.",
        "You're late.",
        "Are you telling me to die?",
        "In the flesh. I came to ask you something.",
        "There have been sightings of a sinister figure, carrying a sharp object, wandering the halls at night.",
        "A strange giggle. The glimmer of a needle in the dark. The sound of a door creaking open and closed.",
        "I suspected as much. Then you leave me no choice.",
        "About what I expected.",
        "That was quite a sprint. A shame you lack stamina. Now, to my duty.",
        "Bernadetta. A word of caution. How would you feel if you fell, or bumped into someone, while carrying around that needle? Please watch where you're going in the future.",
        "How did you manage to faint while standing up? Well, I cannot simply leave her here.",
        "Yes?",
        "That was nothing. It saved me effort in the long run. Leaving you there would have just caused even more trouble.",
        "Is this why you've been circling me like a vulture for the last several hours?",
        "Yet you would have fled if I'd approached. It seems you will avoid me at almost any cost.",
        "You don't need to say it. I know. I'm frightening. I'm told so often.",
        "Apologies. I will be mindful not to laugh in your presence from now on.",
        "You think so?",
        "Hardly. I'm sorry to have frightened you.",
        "She's a lost cause.",
        "Indeed. Did you want something?",
        "I can't accept your apology until I know what it's for.",
        "Is that all? I'm used to that. No apology necessary.",
        "I am merely trying not to frighten you. Is there something wrong with that?",
        "Is that right?",
        "Haha...Hahaha!",
        "You told me not to forgo laughing. So I laughed as hard as I could.  Is it helping to conquer your fear?",
        "A summons from Bernadetta? How historic.",
        "Do you? What is it?",
        "There are no grudges, but very well. I'll accept it.",
        "Some kind of embroidery. A flower. This is certainly lovely, but why give it to me? It seems like something you would send to a female friend or someone you had romantic feelings for.",
        "You would like me to wear this?",
        "Oh, why not. Do I put it here?",
        "Hmm, it really is quite nice. I cannot say that it suits me, but...",
        "Hm...",
        "Nothing else for it, I suppose. I dislike you laughing at me, but it is preferable, at least, to you fleeing in terror. Therefore, I will wear this when I am around you in the future.",
        "If you're going to question me about it, perhaps I'll change my mind.",
        "That is what's most important. Now I suppose it is safe for me to return to my usual strict methods.",
        "This again...",
        "Completely unreasonable. How will I see to this...",
        "A routine matter. No cause for concern.",
        "And?",
        "This has nothing to do with swaying Lady Edelgard's sentiments. I am simply her humble servant. I do what is in her best interest. Whether she cares for me or not is irrelevant.",
        "Any order? What a thing to suggest. But the answer is no. I will decline any directive that I deem would not be beneficial to her.",
        "If it would benefit her in some way for me to marry, then yes, I would marry.",
        "I don't care what you believe. My only wish is to see Lady Edelgard fulfill her ambitions. All other matters pale in comparison.",
        "And I don't care what you think, either. I would make any sacrifice to support Lady Edelgard. It's a shame you've never experienced such devotion.",
        "Then maybe someday you'll understand. Until then, we will never see eye to eye. Now, if you will excuse me, I have much to do.",
        "If it's one or the other, I suppose it would be closer to love than to hate. Why?",
        "You completely misunderstand. Unrequited love? Do I really look like the kind of drooling simpleton to have that kind of motivation?",
        "My situation is simple. I am walking a path.",
        "Everyone has a path in life. Lady Edelgard has shown me mine. It is just beside her own. So we walk together, side by side. We stride ever forward, yielding to nothing and no one.",
        "Bluntly, yes. But it's more than just a shared dream. I have many feelings toward Lady Edelgard. Gratitude. Respect. Awe. Empathy. Trust. Hope.",
        "Why not?",
        "What's this all about now?",
        "You mean the path that Lady Edelgard and I walk?",
        "One person seems enough to me.",
        "Do you have something more to say, Dorothea? It is unlike you to seem so uncertain.",
        "What?",
        "No need to repeat it... I heard you quite clearly.",
        "Seems it's my turn to not understand. Did you just propose marriage as a way to get to know me? How exactly would such an arrangement benefit me?",
        "Go on.",
        "I suppose it may well be. Your contribution to our cause has been noteworthy. I've no complaints about your battle prowess either. And if you are able to walk the path as I do... that would be very special.",
        "Heh. All right. I'll consider it.",
        "Petra. Industrious as ever, I see.",
        "Even accounting for that, your efforts are impressive. I wish a little of you would rub off on certain people here. One troublesome slouch in particular.",
        "Not literally. I would never have imagined you would adjust so well to life in Fódlan. When I first met you, you couldn't understand a single word of the language. You had the look of a cornered animal. So much so I thought you'd grown up in the wild.",
        "It is unfortunate, but while you were called our guest, you were actually a hostage. You were meant to be insurance that Brigid would not restore its alliance with Dagda and attack us. The Empire required leverage, and after all, you are the princess of Brigid.",
        "I admire your spirit in the face of adversity. You set a strong example to follow. And there is much more adversity to come.",
        "Looking out toward Brigid, are you?",
        "It is quite a long way. To say nothing of the sea that lies between here and there. Being unable to return must further add to the distance in your mind.",
        "I believe you will be successful. You may not be Lady Edelgard's equal, but you are resourceful enough to make an excellent queen. And, unlike Lady Edelgard, you will not be forced to harden your heart.",
        "Understand that I mean no disrespect by this. But it is a fact that you are far beneath her. Make no mistake about what would happen if you were to raise your banner in revolt against her. She would crush you mercilessly.",
        "Even if our homelands were on equal footing, Lady Edelgard would still prevail.",
        "How amusing. For your sake, you had better hope you are right.",
        "Hello, Petra. How unusually formal.",
        "Hmm. An astute observation. I should point out that such a comparison only reflects well on you. I am perhaps doing so because you are both royalty.",
        "Comrades in arms, you say...",
        "Ah. I understand you, now. It seems I've done you a great disservice, Petra. Your friendship is important to me. I am sorry that I've failed to make that clear. By comparing you to Lady Edelgard, I have treated you merely as one chasing after her shadow. I have done so even while believing that the Empire and Brigid would never go to war again.",
        "I do not fully understand it, but when I look at you, I simply cannot help but think of Her Majesty. Your past, full of hardship. Your unwavering determination. Your uncommon excellence. As such, I cannot promise never to compare you. But I will try my best to do so less often.",
        "Heh. What an amusing thing to say. Lady Edelgard's face would contort most bitterly were she to hear it.",
        "Yes, I believe it is.",
        "You were right to sever ties with such a miserable piece of filth.",
        "Don't overcomplicate it. I will not forgive him. Ever. Contemptible is just the right word for the wretch. Do you truly know what kind of man my father is?",
        "Yet that's exactly what he did. Since the dawn of the Adrestian Empire, House Vestra has served House Hresvelg as the emperor's right hand. My father spat on a legacy of loyalty and devotion that had lasted 1,000 years. He conspired with the ministers to usurp power from the emperor. And Lady Edelgard...",
        "Now it is the nobles' turn to suffer defeat. Lady Edelgard will be emperor.",
        "I must thank you for leading your expertise to the aid of Her Majesty, Hanneman.",
        "Is that so?",
        "Depends on what it is.",
        "Then, no. Absolutely not.",
        "Clearly, yes. That's exactly what he did. He played a large part in the assault on the palace. Personally spearheaded the emperor's capture. The thought of those treacherous arms reaching out for Her Majesty... It is truly upsetting.",
        "I'll take that under advisement.",
        "Let's say you're right. Suppose he did it to protect something he cared about. Doesn't matter. Doesn't change his actions or my judgement of them. My father was a traitor to House Hresvelg and he deserved what he got. That was me protecting something I care about.",
        "Nothing in particular. I was just recalling your impressive skill with a bow. I'm willing to bet you could put an arrow through the neck of an enemy general from quite a distance. In fact, to any leader's bodyguard, I would go so far as to say you pose the most dangerous kind of threat.",
        "I would certainly hope not. But there are some mercenaries to whom a contract means little. And you would do well to remember that Lady Edelgard is no mere \"princess.\" You should take care to learn the proper form of address for your employer.",
        "What did I just say?",
        "My patience has limits, you know. For the moment, you may stand in Lady Edelgard's good graces. But if you become a problem, I will not hesitate to eliminate you.",
        "Is that a threat?",
        "That's the last of them.",
        "Another threat to Her Majesty? Who's there?",
        "Shamir. What are you doing here?",
        "I was...negligent. I had thought we'd sufficiently thinned the numbers of these scum. Seems I was mistaken. In any case, you have my thanks.",
        "Even so—killing your former allies. Do you feel no remorse whatsoever?",
        "You are not me. Answer the question.",
        "That's right. You're from Dagda. Well, consider me glad you're on the right side. At least for the time being.",
        "All finished. Time to go.",
        "You really must stop sneaking up on me, Shamir.",
        "Maybe. Either way, it's a waste to fight an ally.",
        "That is exactly what I will say I did. But leaving them alive would have been a mistake. I did what had to be done.",
        "Lady Edelgard's time is rightfully occupied with a great deal of concern and contemplation. Her affairs are of far greater consequence than a trifle like this. Much rests on the decisions she makes. But little details of this kind happen to be my area of expertise. So I simply handle them. Better that than to burden her with needless debate.",
        "That is how I do things.",
        "You seem quite thorough in your methods as well.",
        "Stay here? I'm forced to wonder what your intentions might be.",
        "Excuse me? You've what?",
        "It's a fine offer. But perhaps we should wait until after the war to discuss it thoroughly.",
        "Not much I can say to that, is there?"

        "Well, I've thought for a while that it might be nice to paint the scenery here. The contours of that tree, set against the stark shapes of the faraway peaks... Of course, I only paint after I've finished my chores. I'd never put my at before my responsibilities! My studies are paramount. I shall always uphold my duties as a student of the Officers Academy! Whereas art is...a hobby of mine, you might say. Everyone has hobbies, right? I'm sure you have one.",
        "Oh! Well, perhaps it's different for you, Professor. But it's perfectly normal for people to have hobbies. Reading, for instance. Or fishing, or taking midday naps. For me, it's making art. Hobbies are healthy! They're a good way of relieving stress. You might consider taking up a hobby, Professor. Anything to clear your mind. Think about it. It's much easier to focus if you're feeling refreshed. There isn't a rule against hobbies, is there? If you tell me to stop, I'll stop. I shall never again put brush to canvas!",
        "Really? It's OK for me to paint? Well... I mean, if you're sure. But really, it's nothing more than a little diversion. A frivolous pastime. Um, I think I ought to go back to my quarters now, if it's all the same to you.",

        "Of course. Why would you go out of your way to tell him that? Completely illogical of me. But it seems I've developed a bit of complex about it. My father's not a fan of my artistic pastime, you see. We're a merchant family, and my older brother is set to inherit the business. As for me, my father decided I should be a knight. That's why I'm at the academy. Painting won't help me become a knight. It's a waste of time...",
        "Well, yes. I feel like I'm betraying my parents. I hear that business has been slow for them over the past few years. If I become a knight for an influential noble house, I could use my connections to help support them. My father was determined to send me here. He must have been, considering the enormous amount of money he spent. I don't think I'm well suited to being a knight. My parents sent me to the academy for their sake, not my own. When I think about how hard my family is working just to stay in business, how can I sit idly by? All of which is just to say that painting will have to remain my little hobby, nothing more. Not that I could make a career out of it, even if I want to. That's just a fantasy.",
        "How incredible. What a striking color. Ah, Professor! Look at this stone. Such a brilliant blue. You don't normally find stones like this around here. I ought to grind it down. I wonder if it would still be the same color.",
        "To make pigment for my art! Good supplies don't come cheap. I prefer to make my own. Blue is especially expensive. How fortunate that I chanced upon this remarkable blueness! Oh, I'm sorry. There I go again, blathering on and on about painting.",
        "Oh yes, but I know that I can get rather caught up in it and, ah, enthusiastic. You know, Professor, no matter how impassioned I become about my art, you never hold it against me. One could argue that I'm better off preparing for our next battle. I am becoming a knight.",
        "Oh, Professor. Please don't say things like that. I gave up on my artistic dreams long ago. To support my family, I will be a knight. That's that.",
        "I'll continue with my art as a hobby. I don't think I could ever give it up. When I see something beautiful, I can't suppress the urge to paint it. I don't have a choice. And if my art can bring happiness to even one person, that's good enough for me.",
        "...Professor, I have a favor to ask. I'm painting a portrait right now. When it's finished, I'd like to give the piece to you. Would you take it? Perhaps it can bring you a little happiness. That will have made the effort well worth it.",

        "Well, yes. It was a portrait of Sothis, the goddess who descended from heaven to guide humanity. But when I was painting her, I couldn't stop thinking of you. You are the most beautiful thing in the world. And beyond that... OK, here goes nothing. I want you to please accept this. Please. Do you...accept? I can't measure up to you. You're the hero of Fódlan, and I'm just a painter. But I can't lie to myself any longer. I can't live my whole life denying myself what makes me the happiest. You taught me that. Taught me to see myself. You taught me everything. You've always been so patient and attentive. You never made me feel small, or denied my feelings. You soothed my troubled soul. You are my goddess. I want to be with you for the rest of my life...to love you for all eternity. I want to paint your beauty in portrait after portrait. I want to stay by your side—for now, and forever. Will you let me?",
        "What?! Did you say what I think you said? You're accepting me as your partner? I asked you because I didn't want to live with the regret of not asking. I decided to be honest, expecting you to spurn me, and yet... You said yes. You said yes! You said—",
        "Ah, right, sorry. Whew. I almost fainted there. You're sure though? Absolutely positive?",
        "Then I promise to do whatever it takes to be a respectable man, worthy of your partnership. With my paintings, I will bring the world happiness! The same happiness that I feel when I look at you, my beloved goddess. Sorry, was that too much? Maybe I should just leave it at this... I love you. With all of my soul.'''",
        "Gah! Claude! Why didn't you say anything?",
        "I appreciate the sentiment, but I wasn't praying.",
        "I was just thinking about the goddess.",
        "Not here. Let's go somewhere else.",
        "Yes. All right, consider this. The archives here have all kinds of texts about the goddess, right? But when people tell stories of the goddess, it's only myths and legends that glorify her.",
        "C-Claude, don't put words in my mouth! That's not what i said! I was just wondering what the goddess looks like. That's the kind of thing I like to think about.",
        "What?! Claude, please stop! The goddess I imagine is absolutely beautiful!",
        "No. Today I am praying. I'm hoping that if I pray with all my might, she will appear before me.",
        "Yes. Perhaps it's strange to think about such things.",
        "That's a disrespectful way of putting it. I just believe that she's a divine beauty. She'd have to be, considering how she mesmerized the people of Fódlan when she walked among them.",
        "''' You can't go around saying things like that! How am I supposed to answer?",
        "Yes, indeed. Watching over us from above. And they say that some day she will return, to walk amongst us again.",
        "What?! No! If she does appear, I want it to just be the goddess and me.",
        "Why?",
        "Uh, well... That is to say...",
        "Oh... Well, I suppose that makes sense.",
        "Aaah!",
        "Ah, ow, ouch! Oh, my glasses! Where are they? Where are they?!",
        "That's OK, Petra. Just... Have you seen my glasses?",
        "Yes, exactly, yes.",
        "Ah, well, I dropped them. That's why I'm looking for them.",
        "Ah! Thank the goddess. I thought I might be in trouble there.",
        "Are you OK, Petra? You're not hurt?",
        "I'm OK too. Thank you.",
        "Hm? Oh, ages. I can't see without them.",
        "You've never used glasses, I gather. I guess you don't need them.",
        "I kind of figured. I'm a little jealous, to tell the truth.",
        "So bad eyesight means death? Brigid sounds scary.",
        "Oh yeah, lots of hunting in Brigid, right? I guess that requires good eyesight.",
        "Huh? For me?",
        "Something only I can do? That's a lot of pressure. What's it about?",
        "Oh, you want to try my glasses! All right.",
        "So, Petra, what do you think?",
        "Whaaa?! Petra, take them off!",
        "If you lean on me that hard, I'm going to... Aaah!",
        "How are you feeling?",
        "You're...welcome? I guess you shouldn't wear glasses unless you need them.",
        "Haha! Glasses are like Heroes' Relics! What a funny thing to say.",
        "Petra's always so serious. Relics, glasses... I never thought about it like that.",
        "Petra. You always seem so focused on your training.",
        "I want to apologize about the glasses debacle.",
        "When I laughed at what you said. I felt really bad for doing that.",
        "I'm realizing that I can learn a lot from you.",
        "Nothing specific, but more like... You really take things seriously.",
        "You approach the world with genuine curiosity and consider it carefully.",
        "You have a sincere, wholehearted approach to learning new things. I envy that.",
        "You think so? That's kind of reassuring...",
        "Me? Oh, I think that's going too far.",
        "Because I wear glasses?",
        "That was a joke? I didn't realize. I guess it was OK for me to laugh after all.",
        "You always look so humorless. It's hard to judge.",
        "Oh, I don't mean that in a bad way! You're a fun person to be around.",
        "I'll know that you're joking next time, without you telling me.",
        "I think so too! I've been hoping to learn more about you.",
        "The professor wants us to gather at the training grounds. Didn't you hear?",
        "Um. Are you sure you want to wait? I can hear the professor calling.",
        "Oh, I guess so. I was just panicking a bit. I wish I could be calm like you. How are you so unflappable?",
        "Hm! So that's the secret to happiness.",
        "No, it's perfect. I feel like I don't quite fit in with other people. So in situations like this where I have to talk to someone, I panic a little. Please, teach me how to be as calm and collected as you are.",
        "But you always seem so happy! Agh, I'm sorry...",
        "All right. We don't have to rush... But I'm going to anyway. See you there!",
        "Sorry! I shouldn't sigh in such a holy place.",
        "Oh, it's nothing. Not worth talking about.",
        "That's not what I meant! Sorry to offend you. I'll tell you about it. I'm just uncertain about my future. My father wants me to be a knight. I don't think I can handle it. Can you imagine a knight as pathetic as me?",
        "Well, I've always loved painting.",
        "What's your ambition?",
        "Not at all. I'm actually feeling a little better. Knowing that you aren't sure about your future, I don't feel quite so...alone.",
        "There was a beautiful painting of the goddess in the church where I used to live. Whenever times were difficult, I would stare up at her and sigh. Thinking about that painting helps me even now. I've always wanted to paint the goddess.",
        "I can't paint anything powerful enough to do that. I wish I could. Maybe one day... I'll give that some thought. Thank you, Mercedes.",
        "A little. I'm coming to accept that I will never be an artist. I'm self-taught, so my style and technique are probably all wrong. I don't know what I'm doing. Besides, how could I persuade my father? I can't even imagine his reaction. He'd disown me.",
        "But? It's never a bad thing to have dreams. That's how I feel, at least. I can't imagine a life in which I've given up on my dreams.",
        "You know, I suppose you're right! My dream of being an artist gives me the energy to go on. You're really wise, Mercedes.",
        "Really?! I'm pleased to hear you say so! You said you're in the same position as I am. What did you mean by that?",
        "What?!",
        "So, um... Will you get married?",
        "\"Everything will work out in the end.\" Mercedes, you're amazing. I think that, whatever you do, wherever you go, you'll help a lot of people. You're so kind, I know you can— Oh!",
        "For my whole life, I've wanted to paint the goddess. But I never could. Whatever shape I gave her, she never seemed quite right. But it's just come to me. It's wonderful how inspiration can strike so suddenly!",
        "I will! Will you help me?",
        "Don't you see? The goddess I imagined and tried to paint so many times—she's you! I have to get my supplies. Stay right there.",
        "Ingrid! What are you doing here?",
        "Aaaaah! Don't look, don't look!",
        "Really?",
        "I hope you don't think I was ignoring you. When I'm painting, I get totally absorbed.",
        "No! That would be improper!",
        "But she's not a knight.",
        "Yeah, it just kinda came out that way.",
        "It's my fault. I should have stuck to my original idea.",
        "Ingrid! Yes, I'm painting Saint Seiros again.",
        "No, no need to apologize. I appreciated the fresh input. It made me think.",
        "It's the truth! I'm so caught up in my own mind. I'd never have thought to try that.",
        "Yes?",
        "But, but-",
        "I'm not angry. I could never get angry with you. I'm sorry.",
        "Oh! Sorry!",
        "Don't worry, it's my fault, really. I'm not very good at expressing myself.",
        "Oh, OK. Sorry.",
        "Where are you going, Ingrid?",
        "Don't worry. I just finished my painting of Saint Seiros.",
        "Of course! Take a look.",
        "She looks so real, doesn't she? So alive. Perhaps it's boastful for me to say that.",
        "I was going to paint her as loving and benevolent. But then I remembered your idea, and I decided to depict her fighting for her people.",
        "That's right. Although, of course, I had to discard some of your more absurd suggestions.",
        "No, wait! That's not what I meant! I see that if I open myself up to suggestions from other people, new things become possible. And I have you to thank for that realization.",
        "You made a good point. We can't be blinded by our own thought patterns and ideas. It's important to be open to others', as well. By doing so, we discover new paths for ourselves, and we can even become better in ways we may never have imagined.",
        "Me too. And I've just had a new idea for a painting!",
        "Agh! Ingrid! How long were you standing there?",
        "No! I mean... The painting's not ready yet. I don't want anyone to see it before it's finished.",
        "It's not that. This one is embarrassing, is all.",
        "Uh, all right. Just for a second.",
        "Yes. It's you.",
        "That's how I see you. You remind me of Saint Seiros. Brave and vibrant and powerful, yet kind and gentle. Sorry! Was that too much? That was too much.",
        "I'm feeling a little embarrassed myself.",
        "I will. I promise. Though I don't think I'll show it to anyone else.",
        "You want me to pick one?",
        "Ah. Let's see... How about this?",
        "The tea you chose has a very subtle taste, as well as a smooth, light texture. Such an unassuming tea calls for an unassuming pot, and one that complements the tea's color. In addition, the pot I selected has a floral design. Although we can't go for a walk today, we can still bask a little in nature's beauty.",
        "Oh... That sounds wonderful. But I'm afraid I'm already on the path to becoming a knight.",
        "Ah, well... Hm.",
        "Not at all! I just need a little time to think it over.",
        "Aaah! You frightened me!",
        "I thought I'd jot down some sketches of everyone while they're training. And then, later on, I'll try to practice their moves on my own. But I can't really concentrate on sketching if someone's watching me...",
        "Y-you really think so? You know, I always hoped to be an artist.",
        "Becoming a knight was my father's idea... Being an artist is out of the question, I'm afraid.",
        "A knight... who also paints?",
        "Heh. I had never thought of that! Still, I don't understand why you'd want me as one of your knights. As a fighter, I'm unremarkable.",
        "'''' Lorenz... I'd never have guessed you were prone to such eccentric ideas. Thank you. I'm feeling a little more confident after hearing your kind words.",
        "Oh. Hey, Raphael... I'm done eating, so you can sit here if you like!",
        "Ah, it's fine, I'm not that hungry. Anyway, I guess I'll be heading off!",
        "Uh... Oh my! That equipment's looking rusty! Let me fetch some oil.",
        "No, you have to do it as soon as you notice. There's oil in the warehouse. I'll be right back!",
        "Uh, hello, Raphael!",
        "No, uh, that's... Oh, almost forgot, it's time to return this book to the library! I'll just...",
        "What? No! I'm not...running.",
        "Things...can't be the way they were. It's regrettable, but it's the truth.",
        "I mean, you know...what happened to your parents. My parents are the reason your parents died.",
        "Maybe so, but they were taking over for mine because they had other business that day and couldn't go themselves. So, they recommended yours to fill in for them.",
        "No, but see, I...",
        "He's just putting on a brave face. No one is that forgiving...",
        "Mmm... Ah.",
        "Aaaaagh!",
        "R-Raphael! No, I'm...fine...",
        "I don't know about \"worried.\" It's just, you know, your parents...",
        "Aaaagh! What is it?!",
        "I can't just forget about it! You lost your parents! And when you were in need, my family did nothing to help you.",
        "I still can't help but feel responsible, like I owe you somehow!",
        "Are you sure that's what you want?",
        "Raphael, I... Thank you. And I'm sorry about before.",
        "Hey, Raphael. Reading a letter?",
        "Oh, a letter from Maya! I haven't seen her in so long. I bet she's all grown up.",
        "Wow, I can't believe she's gotten that tall!",
        "Is that the picture I drew for her?",
        "To think, she's handling my little doodle with such reverence! That warms my heart. I remember the day I gave Maya that drawing. She looked so happy. Before then, I never knew I could make people happy with art. It was a revelation. I've been drawing and painting ever since, in hopes of becoming an artist one day.",
        "No, that's not possible, I'm afraid. I have to consider my parents' wishes.",
        "Huh, you think so?",
        "Uh, paint you?",
        "Hah, good point! I can certainly try to capture your likeness. I'll paint you with a warm, cheerful expression on your face, to bring Maya comfort.",
        "Are you sure that's what she'd want to see?",
        "I'm not sure about this...",
        "Good morning, Lysithea! Out for a stroll, are we? It's lovely weather for it. I might go wander outside myself. I'm sure I can see some beautiful sights.",
        "Uh, sure?",
        "Oh! Thank you for letting me know, but really, I'm perfectly capable of tying them myself.",
        "Um.",
        "Thanks...",
        "What?! But I examined myself in the mirror before leaving my quarters!",
        "Sorry, Lysithea... You're always so perfectly put together. In fact I'd say you're perfect in all respects... I don't think I've seen you fail at anything.",
        "I see! Well, I think you're very mature. If anything you may be overdoing it somewhat. I mean, people treat me like a child sometimes. But I like it, because it reminds me that other people care about me. You know? No matter how much we stretch, some things are always beyond us. I think it's fine to be vulnerable and ask for help sometimes.",
        "Uh, Lysithea, wait! Hey!",
        "That was uncalled for. After all, I am older than she is.",
        "No, I'm on cooking duty today, and I have to head into town for some groceries.",
        "No, please! I can manage on my own.",
        "Not at all. I'll be fine. I'm just replacing a few ingredients. Also, I may not look it, but I'm actually quite strong. I've been exercising every day!",
        "That's what you think of me, huh?",
        "I see. If that's how you feel...",
        "I'm sorry. That wasn't my intention. I'm just a bit sensitive, that's all. You're talking like you don't respect me.",
        "Oh, enough already! Would you just leave me alone?!",
        "Oh! Lysithea. Something I can do for you?",
        "Yes, of course. You need me to carry stuff?",
        "You're so busy you can't go shopping? OK. Do you have a favorite kind of tea?",
        "One question. Why me? You don't really need my help for this.",
        "Right. I see. Well, good! I'm glad you decided to approach me. Ah, but, for this particular task, you might be better off doing it yourself.",
        "There are so many different kinds of tea, and I'm not very discerning. What if I get you one you don't like? When I do my own shopping, I pick a tea at random. Otherwise I'd be paralyzed by all the choices. It's the same with food. Sometimes I stare and stare at the options and never decide.",
        "I really had to push myself to do that alone. I don't think I can do that again. Sorry...",
        "Yeah. Still, though... For today, how about you have some of my tea? If that'll do...",
        "OK! Though I can't do it as skillfully as Lorenz, I'm afraid. I'll get it ready right away. Feel free to start focusing on your work.",
        "What?",
        "I do? Really? How so?",
        "Well, I'm just pouring you some tea. I'm not sure that qualifies as \"help.\"",
        "Well, there aren't many things I can do, frankly. What I can do, I will do! So if you need anything, ask me, and I'll try to help.",
        "Yes, that's the last of them. Thank you, Marianne. Just when I thought all the laundry was dry, the wind got stronger, and... By the time I realized what was happening, there were clothes dancing across the sky!",
        "I didn't imagine that they would float all the way to the stables. Thanks again for helping me pick them up.",
        "Well, now I can hang it all back up before sunset. Everything should be dry by the day's end. All right, I should get to... Ahhh!",
        "Heh, uh-huh. The hamper's just a little heavier than it looks. Do you think you could give me a hand?",
        "Phew, we got here just in time. Thanks for the help hanging everything up.",
        "Ah.",
        "What is it?",
        "Oh no, that's all right. After all, just look over there.",
        "They were mere buds until just the other day. Now look at those gorgeous blooms!",
        "If we'd been chatting away, we might never have noticed them. Sure, the laundry was an ordeal, but...at least there was a silver lining.",
        "Hey, Marianne. Are you there?",
        "Do you have a minute?",
        "Then, if you don't mind... Would you come with me for a moment?",
        "Yes, indeed. I have an urgent request.",
        "Oh no, it's nothing like that! Really, you don't have to worry.",
        "Would you close your eyes, please?",
        "Just take my hand. That's it. There, right there. Perfect. Now open your eyes.",
        "Yes. Isn't it beautiful?",
        "I was looking at it earlier, and I thought to myself, \"I have to show Marianne.\"",
        "Because you're always looking at your shoes! You never get a chance to appreciate the scenery.",
        "See, the best thing about the scenery is, it's always changing—with the weather, the time of day, the season. So every view is unique, never to be repeated. If no one sees it, it's lost.",
        "I wanted to share this beautiful landscape with you.",
        "Hey, that's OK. I won't try to express this beauty in words either. Just look and remember. This will make for a nice memory. And maybe...remember that I was here too.",
        "Huh. What's that about?",
        "Marianne, I saw you on the training grounds earlier. It looked like there was an argument.",
        "Are you sure? Nothing happened at this morning's training?",
        "OK. Tell me what happened.",
        "They may have a point.",
        "Of course not. That goes without saying.",
        "It's hard to accomplish anything on your own. Look at me! By myself, I'm worse than useless. Can you see where I'm going with this? To succeed, you have to cooperate. You can't do that if you're not paying attention to nonverbal cues.",
        "Please, try looking up, looking people in the eye. You'll see some things that you've never seen before. People worry about you, and rely on you. You'll see that in your allies' faces. In a way, you'll see what they're thinking.",
        "Of course! Look. We both saw the sunset and appreciated in its beauty. Nature communicates without words. We can do the same. We don't need to speak to be understood. Stop staring at your feet! Look at us. That'll be a good start.",
        "Oh, no! To the contrary. I just realized I was missing something. A thing of remarkable beauty, right under my nose...",
        "Ah, what? Don't mind me!",
        "No, that's all right. Actually, I'm just finishing up.",
        "Thank you very much. So, anyway, you can go now.",
        "You were talking to your friend, right? I just have some things to put away. It's OK, I can manage without you.",
        "It's all right, you were having a conversation. I didn't want to sneak up like I was eavesdropping. And really, I didn't need help.",
        "Glad to be of service. I'll start putting all this away.",
        "Wh-what's the matter?",
        "Oh, uh, I didn't expect to hear that from you.",
        "Um... Personally, I'd prefer to lose out, rather than inconvenience someone else. For instance, I'd have felt terrible for intruding on your important conversation earlier. Consider the negligible loss to me, versus the major inconvenience to you. Personal loss is always going to be the better choice, right?",
        "Yes, hello, Hilda. What's the matter?",
        "Ah, um, I'm really sorry, but actually...",
        "Some people got hurt while training in magic. I'm rushing to grab medical supplies.",
        "Thanks. I'll be right back. ''''",
        "Sorry to keep you waiting. Now, what was the book you were looking for?",
        "Yes, it turned out to just be some scrapes and bruises. Oh, is that the book?",
        "Huh. You could have just asked someone else for their help.",
        "I see. Well, I'm sorry I couldn't help.",
        "I thought you might wait for me to come back, that's all.",
        "That's thoughtful of you, Hilda. Thanks for watching out for me.",
        "I'm glad you liked it! You're really good at giving compliments, you know that? I suppose that's why everyone's so eager to help you with things.",
        "I wish I had everything figured out like you.",
        "Hey, Hilda. Is something wrong?",
        "Oh, that's a mess. Here, let me help. That can leave stains if you're not careful.",
        "Oh, no, don't worry. I'm on a break.",
        "Ah, yes. The weather's quite splendid, and I found a place where some gorgeous flowers are blooming. But the flowers aren't going anywhere this second. Let's clean this up!",
        "That's OK. It didn't stain, at least! We picked all the leaves out of the carpet.",
        "No, I think time-wise it'll be fine... If you're not doing anything, Hilda, would you care to join me?",
        "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. Forget what I said. I'm sure you're busy anyway.",
        "Well, no, but you didn't reply, so I thought you didn't want to.",
        "Whew, that's good! Wait, you're... you're glad?",
        "Right, right, of course. It's affirming.",
        "Of course, of course. Well then. In addition to seeing the flowers with me, would you like to help with my painting?",
        "No, I meant that I'd like to paint you, with the flowers all around you... Oh, that's too much, isn't it? Forget I said anything!",
        "I'm sorry, I—",
        "Huh? Yes, of course! I'll paint you cute as a button!",
        "Oh, Professor! Here's the map you..",
        "Well... There's always next time, I suppose.",
        "Oh, no, nothing urgent. You didn't cut short your conversation because of me, did you?",
        "The bows? Is something wrong with them?",
        "Ah, I see. I suppose people would prefer if you went back to the lighter bowstrings.",
        "I can see how slower shooting is a drawback, but the arrows flying father... That actually sounds like a good thing.",
        "Oh, good point! You know a lot about bows, don't you?",
        "Me? Oh, no. I don't think so.",
        "I hope so.",
        "I'm sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt you.",
        "I'm sorry. I didn't know you were training out here.",
        "You're right. A real battlefield feels quite different. But if that's the atmosphere you want, I feel even more like I'm intruding.",
        "Ah, okay. Sorry. Thank you. Sorry to bother you.",
        "Oh, I'm so... Ah.",
        "Uh, yes. Yes. When I have time, that is. I enjoy painting. It helps me relax.",
        "My... \"thing?\" Huh? What do you mean?",
        "M-my paintings are nothing but a hobby! Besides, I'm not that good. I never took art lessons. When... When I was little, I drew a picture for a young girl. The picture made her so happy that I decided to keep at it. That's how it started.",
        "Oh, no, that's an overstatement. I must insist, again, it's just a hobby. Even if I were to become a master artist, it wouldn't be a useful skill.",
        "I'm not inheriting the business. My brother is. My father said that I'm to become a knight. So my art won't do anyone any good. At all. Ever.",
        "Ah, Leonie. Off to train?",
        "No, I'm on my way back. I was thinking of adding a little color to my latest piece, so...",
        "It doesn't work like that! You have to let me know in advance. I need time to prepare.",
        "Wherever we travel, I try to capture the feeling and character of the landscape. I guess they've all kind of piled up. Each place is unique, not just the geography, but also the clothing and the architecture and so on. Everywhere has its own design sensibilities.",
        "Just within the Alliance, the styles are quite different between the north and south. And the Empire's even more diverse.",
        "The blue of the sky changes with the season too. In the summer, it's darker. And yet in the winter, it's almost luminous. And, of course, the landscape below affects the sky's appearance, by virtue of contrast. It's hard to get the color just right, so I spend a lot of time experimenting with pigments, and— oh no! I'm sorry. I've been talking your ear off.",
        "Huh?",
        "Oh, no, I wouldn't go nearly that far.",
        "You think so?",
        "Thank you, Leonie. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a lot to think about.",
        "I am. I suppose that's rather irresponsible, as we're in the midst of a war. But ever since we last spoke, I've felt keen to pursue my artistic aspirations.",
        "All right, I'll try to embrace it! And you, are you practicing archery today?",
        "Okay. Well, let's both do our best!",
        "I'll try to discuss it with my parents after the war. There's little demand for knights in peacetime. In fact, painting might be a more reliable way for me to support my family. I'll try to persuade them with arguments along those lines.",
        "Come to think of it, Leonie, what will you do when the war is over?",
        "A mercenary in peacetime?",
        "I'm sure you can do whatever you put your mind to.",
        "I don't think there's any rush. You can travel and relax and think about it.",
        "Huh? Me?",
        "Yes, I suppose I do. I'd like to see the whole world.",
        "Oh, no. I want us to see the world together. Your presence makes every landscape more beautiful.",
        "Oh, uh, that's not what I meant!",
        "Ngh... Flayn! I'm so sorry! Are you hurt?",
        "Are you sure you're all right? Are you injured?",
        "We should go to the infirmary. Come on, I can take you there.",
        "Uh, yes! I'm sorry, did you say something?",
        "Understand what?",
        "Oh! No! No, no, no! You misunderstood! I just...",
        "I'm just...fascinated. By you.",
        "Yes. Your gaze, full of divine dignity. Your silhouette, as elegant as a statue. If Saint Cethleann herself were reborn, you would look no less wondrous than she.",
        "I'm sorry! So sorry! I don't know what came over me, saying something like that.",
        "Uh... Well, from the few accounts that I've heard, she was a beauty, and her kindness was inexhaustible.",
        "Yes, I'd be most grateful if you didn't. I can hardly imagine what Seteth would do if he found out.",
        "She seemed awfully pleased, didn't she? Hmm...",
        "Hmm... Nothing here.",
        "Oh, Flayn! I've just been researching the exploits of Saint Cethleann.",
        "Well, painting is a hobby of mine, and I thought I might like to capture her likeness.",
        "If I wanted to use a statue of Saint Cethleann for my reference, it wouldn't be necessary. But that's not that I want. I want to paint Saint Cethleann herself, looking exactly as she did when she was alive. And if I don't know anything about who she was on the inside, the image won't be true to life. So I wanted to find some hints about who she was, and that's why I've been researching her deeds.",
        "Girl? Interesting way of putting it. But, yes. More or less.",
        "Uh. What's happening?",
        "Huh? But I thought the saints gathered following a revelation from the goddess.",
        "But according to legend, she used her miraculous powers to heal all of the wounded...",
        "Having heard all that, I'd say she seems... incredible.",
        "Huh. Who knew Flayn was such an expert on Cethleann?",
        "Flayn! Excuse me, quick question. Can I paint you?",
        "I'd like to paint your portrait, Flayn. For some reason, whenever I try to visualize Saint Cethleann, I think of you.",
        "\"More illustrious\" than the statue? Surely you mean, \"as illustrious\".",
        "Well, true, you are a sight to behold. Though I'm not sure about the competitive tenor of that question. I'd expect you, as an admirer of Saint Cethleann, to speak more... admiringly?",
        "A pose? Ah, no, no need. You can just sit down.",
        "A few days, I'd imagine. But that's OK. You can just come by wherever you have time. Oh, and, if you don't mind, could you tell me some more stories about her? The stories you tell about Saint Cethleann are so much more vivid than the other legends I've heard. She seems so... impressive. So fierce. I can't help but admire her too.",
        "Uh, sure, I guess? I think \"cute\" might suit you a little better though.",
        "Um, I'm not sure I can ever produce a painting that completely satisfies you. But I'll try! I said I would, and I will not go back down on my word! Even if this painting takes me months. That wouldn't be a problem, would it?",
        "Haha, thank you for that. Though I hope it doesn't take quite that long....",
        "Phew, today's training was murder... Ah, Shamir! I have a question for you.",
        "Um... Shamir?",
        "Oh, I suppose she's meditating or something. Never mind then, I guess...",
        "Agh! Shamir?",
        "Uh, n-no! It's not important.",
        "Ah, no, it's not... You're probably tired anyway.",
        "Y-yes, understood. I'll remember that for next time.",
        "Um, yes, I'm OK for today. Sorry to disturb you. I'll be leaving now.",
        "Um, excuse me. Shamir?",
        "Yes. I was curious about the world beyond Fódlan.",
        "You came from somewhere outside Fódlan, right? I'm curious about your homeland, what kind of place it was, and I thought you might...",
        "Sorry?",
        "I, uh, I see. All right, then.",
        "Oh! That's what it was. That's...good.",
        "I thought maybe you didn't like me.",
        "Oh, um, I don't actually know! I'm not very good at reading people, I guess.",
        "I... I'm not that brave. I'm sorry, I'll leave you alone! I'll be going now!",
        "Really? Oh, whew, I'm so glad I asked!",
        "There's so much I have yet to see. Even these days, when it's ravaged by conflict, the world is so diverse. Buildings and landscapes and geography differ vastly from place to place. There's so much variety within Fódlan, and the outside world must be even more varied! I feel so inspired just thinking about it. So I'd like to travel there some day.",
        "You think so?",
        "Yes. Perhaps so...",
        "You've never talked to me like this before, Shamir.",
        "Ah, sorry... Hearing you talk about exploring the world made me think about what I should do with myself. Do you have plans for the future, after the war?",
        "Ahead of you, Shamir? I highly doubt that.",
        "Yes, of course. Shamir, may you find success in everything you do!",
        "Oh, I... Can I help you with something? You must be struggling by yourself, Cyril!",
        "But we could do it so much faster working together!",
        "I don't mind. Plus, if we finish early, you can go and do whatever you like.",
        "Sure! Tell me.",
        "Oh... Ok.",
        "Wow, it hurts when you put it like that. I've been meaning to ask you about Almyra. You always look so busy, but I thought you might talk to me if I helped you with your work.",
        "But I find it all so fascinating! Please, tell me about the people, the buildings, the flowers... Ooh! Any scenery you liked looking at?",
        "Even though you endured hardships, there must have been some things you enjoyed.",
        "Ok. Sorry to bother you. Let me know if I can help. Oh, and... I hope we can talk some other time.",
        "Cyril, hello. I was just looking outside. Are you off to work right now?",
        "Oh, you're going to get rid of the puddle over there? That's a shame.",
        "I've quite enjoyed looking at the puddle. But pay me no mind. The work needs doing, I know.",
        "Well, look at it. With the addition of the puddle, the whole landscape has changed dramatically. Plus, it's perfectly unique. No two puddles are alike. Light will never again hit the water in quite the same way. This whole landscape is unique, in fact. Here, now, for us to enjoy. It didn't exist a moment ago, and it won't exist in a moment.",
        "Your mood just brightened, Cyril. And that made the world a little brighter, didn't it? That's the other thing about looking at a landscape. The view is affected by the viewer's feelings.",
        "Maybe the image in your memories is affected by your emotional state. Anyway, it sounds fascinating. Endless plains, boundless sky. That's Almyra, huh? The thought makes my pulse quicken.",
        "Am I? Heh, I suppose I am.",
        "Well, when you put it like that! Still, I'd love to see Almyra some day. Cyril, after the war, would you go there with me? We can make some memories of your homeland that aren't all dull and lonely!"
    ],
    "Ingrid": [
        "Thank you for sparring with me, Your Highness. It seems despite how hard I've worked, I'm still no match for you.",
        "If you're going to praise me, it should at least be after I've won a match against you.",
        "No, I cannot allow that. It's my duty to get stronger, to fight with all I have in defense of the Kingdom and its people.",
        "So, you recognized it? Yes, he shared much with me.",
        "Ah, yes–he was never short on praise for you! \"Lord Dimitri is incredible–such skill! There's no way I'll ever outmatch him!\" Things of that sort.",
        "Well, he was Felix's brother. That family's not big on displays of affection.",
        "So it has. Time moves quickly. Things have changed so much. Despite the sorrow, I intend to become a powerful knight. A knight like yourself...and like Glenn. I will do so for the sake of my homeland, the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, and for all who have died protecting it. To that end...I hope you will spar with me again in the future, Your Highness.",
        "What? Why do you seem so serious?",
        "No, Your Highness. There's...there's no need to apologize. Glenn's death... It still doesn't feel real. I always looked up to Glenn. He was the very picture of a perfect knight–noble and virtuous. In the end, he laid down his life–the ultimate sacrifice. I feel proud of him in ways that words can't quantify.",
        "That's right. I feel proud that he died for those he was sworn to protect. Proud that he passed from this realm to the next a perfect knight.",
        "Needless death? How can you say that? Glenn gave his life for you–for everyone–and this is how you speak of his sacrifice?",
        "I don't care to hear your interpretation of his final moments! He was and will always be an ideal knight!",
        "Pardon me? He served in your guard! He took great pride in what he did–in protecting you! The very least you can do...is not spit on his memory! If you'll excuse me.",
        "Your Highness. I've come to apologize. I mismanaged my feelings and got carried away. I've been thinking about what might have made you say the things you did... I was so caught up in the moment, and in my own feelings, that I didn't think of what yours might be.",
        "Of course.",
        "A king must, at times, order his soldiers and knights to fight and die on his behalf. Their lives must be used for the greater good–this is something any good king understands innately. Any king who doesn't allow people to die on his behalf is too soft to rule well.",
        "No. I chose to serve you because of how you are. As a knight, I will stand by your side and uphold our soft–hearted ideals.",
        "I've realized that I haven't been facing a very important truth. Because of you, I can finally move on. Thank you.",
        "That was nothing more than a fluke. My technique was horribly sloppy that last round.",
        "You may recall when I said I'm now able to move on. Because of you.",
        "That I finally understand a truth about Glen... It sounds as though he died with a heavy heart–a heart that carried regret. I had suspected as much. But instead of acknowledging it, I twisted my memory of him to fit an ideal I've been upholding.",
        "Your Highness. I will not sacrifice my life for anyone. But perhaps, instead, I can live my life for someone. I will pledge my life to you.",
        "However you please, Your Highness...",
        "As your knight! Yes, yes of course! Of course I will. I intended to do so for your–For the sake of the Kingdom. Together, Your Highness, You and I. Our first order of business–putting this tragic war to an end!",
        "Yes, Your Highness. I swear it on my lance.",
        "Claude.",
        "The sun just barely dipped below the horizon, yet you're already preparing for bed?",
        "I'm almost certain you have never been awake at sunrise, Claude.",
        "Uh-huh, sure. And I've decided to quit my pursuit of knighthood. At least try to make you excuses more believable. And that yawn just now - you didn't even bother covering your gaping mouth. One would never know you're of noble birth, with how you conduct yourself.",
        "You're actually telling me to smile more, aren't you? How common! Hmm, since you're so insistent on telling me what my face should be doing, perhaps my blade can restructure your face with a more permanent smile.",
        "And just how long do you plan on lounging about, yawning like a slob? At least lounge in your own quarters!",
        "Honestly, some people...",
        "Yes, Claude?",
        "If anyone should be making apologies, it's probably me. I've been overly harsh toward you on more than one occasion. I am close friends with someone who has caused me no end of trouble since we were very young. You remind me a bit of him, and I think I've projected my annoyances at him onto you, at times.",
        "Not in every regard, no. You certainly seem to treat those of the opposite gender with quite a bit more respect, for one thing.",
        "You also speak to me in a much more amicable manner than my dear friend ever does.",
        "Oh? Really?",
        "You have a point.",
        "I've got better things to concern myself with. In any case, you speak as though you know so much about wooing the masses. But I would wager that many of our classmates find it difficult to trust one as slovenly as yourself.",
        "That seems like an unreasonable thing to ask of you. I wonder if you're capable of such a thing...",
        "I suppose it's only virtuous to ask as much of myself as I'm asking of you. Very well. I accept your challenge!",
        "Well, hello there. If it isn't Claude. Always a pleasure.",
        "That's kind of you to say.",
        "Oh, goodness. Only if you think someone as lowly as myself might be of service.",
        "Oh, goodness!",
        "What do you expect? Speaking to me as you were, I only responded in kind!",
        "I mean...yes! You do. You sound nothing short of ridiculous.",
        "Excuse me?! I'll admit it was a bit forced, but it certainly doesn't warrant such a title.",
        "I agree. I must say I have an easier time getting on with you when you're you in all your you-ness. Come to think of it, you've always been more reliable than most anyone I know, when it really mattered.",
        "I'm sure I can remedy that for you.",
        "My \"lectures\", as you call them, only persist as long as is necessary.",
        "You honestly expect me to believe that? Come back here, Claude!",
        "It was indeed, Claude. It's so nice to see you.",
        "I thank you for the concern. You are ever so kind.",
        "That sounds so lovely. Perhaps I should do the same.",
        "Whatever do you mean?",
        "You can't be serious. I always knew you were a layabout, but I see now you are also an insensitive nitwit too. If I lecture, you complain. If I act pleasant, you also complain!",
        "Please, tell me how to behave! At least if you're commandeering my behavior, I'll get less of an earful of your complaints. Have you ever once considered thinking before you speak? And you wonder why people so rarely trust you!",
        "Wow, quite the apology. Sounds a lot like one of your myriad excuses. Do you really expect empty apologies to help you get your way?",
        "There you go again! You and your excuses! ...I thought if I made extra efforts to be pleasant, he and I might finally interact without bickering. I just don't know what the best approach is with him.",
        "Were you listening to everything I just said? ugh. I thought you'd run off!",
        "As if an occasional lecture could ever cut it...",
        "Bernadetta, please come out of your room. You've been in there for ages. You need to train.",
        "** '''''': I'm not playing around, Bernadetta. This training is absolutely crucial to your future.",
        "Why did you come here?",
        "I suppose not everyone has to be pleased about being here, but even so... Bernadetta, I'll ask one more time—please come out of there.",
        "You leave me no alternative. If you're near the door, you'd better step away. Aaaagh!",
        "Now hurry along, Bernadetta. You've got lots of training to catch up on.",
        "Is that so? That presents a problem. I know we are two very different people. But whether or not you like me, we are on the same side and must learn to work together.",
        "Don't ask questions you don't want answers to. I did what was necessary to get you to comply. Nothing more. I do hope that the professor will be able to help you through the rest of your training. In the meantime, I will fix your door. Good luck.",
        "Ah, there you are. I just checked your room, but obviously you weren't in there.",
        "Of course not. I'm not unreasonable. I just wanted to discuss something with you.",
        "Firstly, I'd like to apologize... for breaking down your door. I'm sorry. It was perhaps a bit rash. There was a period of time, quite a while ago, when I acted much the same as you. I spent many hours locked away in my own room.",
        "**Really. Because I understood where you were coming from, I knew I had to intervene.",
        "Don't speak so disparagingly of yourself. It doesn't help things. You have plenty of strengths.",
        "Just look at how quickly you sprint back to your room, for example. With more practice, I have a feeling you could outrun most anyone. You're also exceedingly talented in the arts. Surely there's a creative way to apply those talents on the battlefield. Stop wasting your breath and energy on putting yourself down. Just try your best. I'm not giving up on you. You have so much power in you, just waiting to be unleashed.",
        "Excellent. Let's be on our way.",
        "That got us here much quicker, don't you think? Let's begin. Let's warm up by sparring.",
        "Giving in so soon? There's no such thing as \"surrender\" on the battlefield.",
        "Uh...we are?",
        "I see... What's it about?",
        "That's quite a story—sounds tragic and beautiful. Who will be playing the princess?",
        "That does sound quite lovely... And I do want to go, but I...um...",
        "No, no! It's not that. I just...uh... I struggle with the elegant part of things. I don't really do myself up in elegant clothing and makeup and such.",
        "I am?",
        "Oh, goodness. OK...",
        "Why are you sighing at me like that? Is my face really so hopeless?",
        "I mean...I don't. Dorothea, I appreciate you taking the time, but yes, you do have your work cut out for you.",
        "I was just never interested before. Even as a child, it never appealed to me. Fussy, pretty things always felt unnecessary. And gussying myself up to attract someone has never played an important part in my pursuits as a knight. But you've piqued my interest in all this.",
        "It's not like I'd be dressing myself up just to attract someone. I'd be dressing up for the occasion, specifically. Even if I don't dress up any other time, a special occasion such as this is a good reason to try it out.",
        "That's the exact opposite of what I just said. You said previously that dressing up for the occasion is reason enough.",
        "I see.",
        "Could they be? I don't know that I'd forgive them.",
        "Permission is not granted–ever! Just back off.",
        "No.",
        "I'd have cut my way through. Alone. Without your assistance.",
        "Your apologies are empty.",
        "I... I spoke out of turn. I'm sorry, Dedue. His Highness has put his faith in you. You're a valuable comrade, no matter my feelings. I... The people of Duscur...",
        "I... I see.",
        "I see. Then I will accept your help. On the battlefield.",
        "Dedue. Saving the day again?",
        "I'm the one who owes you an apology. You've saved my life how many times now? If I keep being so callous, I'll seem ungrateful.",
        "But...",
        "I'm sorry, Dedue.",
        "Because the way I speak to you is unnecessarily harsh. The truth of it is, I lost someone very dear to me in Duscur. The punishment came swift to your people, and when I heard of the slaughters... Well... I thought it was a punishment well earned. I thought the people cruel and heartless, deserving of the tragedy that befell them.",
        "But you? You're different. You seem nothing like the people of whom I speak. So why not speak back against how I and so many others feel? Why not question this unfair prejudice, and tell me I haven't the right to hold a grudge against you? If you'd just speak to me— if you'd tell me the truth about all of this...",
        "Whatever the truth of it is, you are not to blame. The people I hate are the ones who are responsible for that whole mess. You... you just got caught up in all of it.",
        "You've rushed to my side— you've saved me countless times. I am sorry for how I've treated you. Truly.",
        "Uh, Dedue? Are you OK? You look unwell.",
        "Uhh... What? I mean... um, sort of— er, not exactly... I wouldn't use the word frightening. Aggressive, maybe? But it's really nothing to worry about. Why— did someone say something cruel?",
        "Oh. I see... Let me guess. You feel like you look frightening, so you walked around with a smile glued to your face...",
        "I'm starting to understand how you think. The thing is, forced smiles never work well. They usually just end up making a person look creepy and insincere.",
        "To be honest, when we first met, I was pretty intimidated by you. Not because of a smile, but a lack of emotion whatsoever. And you so rarely spoke. I had no idea what to make of you.",
        "But that's only because I wasn't making an effort to get to know you. Because you were from Duscur. As I started to get to know you— to understand your personality— I realized what a fool I'd been.",
        "You may come off as intimidating, but underneath that cold exterior is a kind, loyal, and noble person— a really wonderful person. In a certain regard, you are one of the knightliest people I know.",
        "What is it?",
        "It's only awkward if you make it awkward. Which... it kind of is... now.",
        "Ugh...",
        "Yes, of course. Same to you, Dedue.",
        "Felix, there you are. I've been looking all over for you. Time for our tactics lecture. You'll be there, won't you?",
        "Nonsense. You're going to be there.",
        "Why is this such a chore? You went last time. Though you did all you could to disrupt things, as I recall. Brazenly rambling on about clear-cutting a nearby forest to secure a marching route. And attacking an enemy base, stealing their horses. You were incredibly disruptive and even rude.",
        "Then, you left before we were finished! What do you suppose happened after that?",
        "Well, the conversation got quite lively. We all began breaking down the viability of your somewhat maniacal plan. And apparently, similar tactics have been used to turn the tides of historic battles.",
        "If you didn't have so much battlefield experience, you wouldn't be capable of such unique strategies. Which is why we need people like you—people who think creatively—to lead the army.",
        "When have you ever minded? We need you there. Just come on.",
        "Oh, hello. Have you been there long? I was absorbed in this book.",
        "First of all, they're not silly. And second of all, no. It's an essay that speaks to uncommon and challenging battle scenarios. I've been researching such things since you proposed your unique strategy. Listen to this—\"Your commander gives orders that put your hometown in extreme danger. Do you carry out the order or protect your hometown?\"",
        "Whatever your personal feelings on the matter, I see similarities between such tactics and these \"dumb\" ethical questions. I haven't read beyond this one, but I think the obvious answer is to follow your commander.",
        "The duty and pride of being a knight demand that you follow orders, regardless of your own feelings. But if I were put in such a position, I don't know how I'd fare... In fact, were someone to carry out those orders, I know that I'd attempt to stop them.",
        "Excuse me?",
        "I know you hate the ideals of chivalry and pride. So much so, you prefer to escape your duty as your family's heir. You have no right to criticize me for my ideals.",
        "Don't you dare bring Glenn into this...",
        "Why are you taking over my cleaning responsibilities?",
        "You're still fretting over me, are you? I'm fine now, really. It wasn't even serious.",
        "Yes, yes, we all know you could've. But I also didn't want to risk something unforeseen befalling you. I've been doing some thinking. I feel a bit lost– I don't know that I'm cut out to be a knight after all. Without fulfilling that dream– without being a knight– I've been asking myself where my place is in the world. And I think... I think I've found my answer. I don't want to lose anyone anymore. So I want to protect those I hold dear.",
        "Foolish to act in line with what I value most? Were I to die, I would die knowing I followed my heart– my truest calling. I've been reading through more of that book I was telling you about. Recall the hypothetical question posed? \"Do you carry out the orders or protect your hometown?\"",
        "The book never specified that one should prioritize the commander's orders. Instead it suggested that one should follow their heart in the matter. That's what a knight– that's what anyone being true to themselves– should do.",
        "Of course. And I find value in that opinion. Glenn died following his heart. Not heeding the commands of the country or even the royal family. I will follow his example. No matter the outcome, no matter the circumstance, I believe in myself.",
        "What is it that you known, then? What is it you fight for, Felix?",
        "I see no difference from my own stance.",
        "You fight to be stronger than everyone, that you might protect those you care for. Correct?",
        "To avoid annoyance, then, I suggest you continue to grow stronger. If that happens, I might allow you to protect me too.",
        "Hi there, Ashe! Here to do some reading as well, I take it?",
        "Uh, Ashe?",
        "Not too long. Apologies for startling you. Must be a great book, for you to be so deeply engrossed in it. What has you so captivated?",
        "Aha, it must be the \"Sword of Kyphon,\" then, yes?",
        "Oh, yes. I know it quite well. I read it often as a child. In fact, I read it so much that my personal copy fell apart. I brought it everywhere with me. I adore that book.",
        "The tale of the warrior Kyphon, whose devotion and loyalty enabled his best friend, Loog, to become king. He went to great lengths to see things through.",
        "Indeed! He was the very picture of the perfect knight. In my opinion, the best chapter is right around the middle of the book...",
        "I never grow weary of that tale—the pinnacle of knighthood, with all its struggles and glory.",
        "Some people laugh at me for reading these old tales, but I'll never outgrow them.",
        "I'm glad of it as well. Tell me, what other books do you enjoy, Ashe?",
        "Ah, you have fantastic taste! That story is another favorite. The final chapter makes me tear up every time...",
        "It seems we have much in common. I look forward to chatting again sometime.",
        "Oh, yes. I know it like the hilt of my sword.",
        "I really like this one—the one in the middle. The knight who stands in defense of the duke.",
        "That makes sense. He's so noble and virtuous. In fact, he kind of reminds me of you.",
        "Ah, no... I'm nowhere near as great. Maybe someday.",
        "Together, yes... Now wouldn't that be something? If only we could.",
        "Ashe. The legends are exactly that—legends. They're not indicative of real life. The cards we are dealt are what they are. We can work with what we have, but we can't change what's in our hand.",
        "I long to serve His Highness as a knight—the sort of knight that legends are written about. But I was born bearing a Crest, and with that comes responsibility. Whether I like it or not, I am the \"last hope\" of House Galatea. I am the only one who can carry on the family bloodline and restore our lost fortune. To do that means setting aside my own dreams and ambitions. Though I've turned my back on House Galatea, what is expected of me as a Crest bearer has not changed.",
        "Ashe... I must ask something of you.",
        "My dream...is aligned with your own. Please, for both of us, promise to see yours through.",
        "I'll never be able to see my dream through. Doing so would mean...terrible misfortune for others. So...I am bound by honor not to follow through on my own dream. But...I can help you achieve yours.",
        "Whoa! Uh— Hi, Ashe. You seem excited. What's that you're holding?",
        "For me? Ashe, this looks very costly. Antique books like this are never cheap... Wow. The cover is stunning. And the binding is still in fantastic condition.",
        "Why did you go to so much trouble?",
        "Well then, I will read it. Oh, the knight on the cover looks striking.",
        "There's an aura of stoicism intermingled with beauty—even amid a gruesome battle. Wait! Looking closer at the face... This knight is a woman!",
        "Thank you for the encouragement, Ashe. Living as a knight is certainly not an easy task. I know it will mean much pain, strife, and heartache. But I still want to pursue that dream. Talking to you has reminded me... I'm not the type who gives up easily.",
        "So to start, I'm going to read this book.",
        "I look forward to it, Ashe.",
        "Tell me, Sylvain. What am I to you?",
        "An old friend, is it? Then why must I clean up the casualties left behind by your... Your skirt chasing!",
        "Do you mean to imply you have no intention of acting a bit more respectably?",
        "When you were eight, you came on to my sweet, sweet granny. My granny!",
        "When you were ten, we went to that harvest festival and you started making eyes at a scarecrow!",
        "When you were fifteen, you sought-relentlessly, might I add-to involve yourself with Lord Gwendal's daughter. Who do you suppose made peace with the furious lord, despite having nothing to do with it? Hm? Me. Always me, always for you. Every time.",
        "My point is this has to end. Not later, but now.",
        "Yeah... That's the sigh of exhaustion after spending the past month apologizing for your behavior to, well, everyone.",
        "If by restrained you mean falling all over yourself to garner the attention of every passing female, then, yes, you've been restrained. Mark my words-the more you hurt people, the more weighty the repercussions will be. Your actions will come around to bite you.",
        "If you end up getting maimed or killed by a pitchfork, don't expect me at your funeral. Glenn used to make light of getting hurt too. Then one day, he got more than hurt. Now he's gone.",
        "Nothing affected me the way his passing affected me.",
        "Your predictability is utterly disappointing. When I finally stopped mourning, you know what brought me back? My concern. For you.",
        "You know you can't get along without me following in your shadow and caring for you. You flirt with anything that has a pulse, offend people left and right, and constantly cause commotion.",
        "Please, Sylvain. Consider your actions before you carry them out. And stop acting so nonchalant about getting hurt or killed. Promise me that.",
        "I hate to break it to you, Sylvain, but there's nobody here for you to flirt with, so there's not much reason to hang around.",
        "How ridiculous. Almost as ridiculous as your face.",
        "Sure. Just don't get in my way.",
        "Hitting on me? Again? Have some dignity, would you?",
        "I'll stay as long as I can. You're useless without me, after all.",
        "Whatever helps you feel better. Stay and protect me, then. I couldn't bear it if you went off and died on me while I wasn't around.",
        "It's getting late. We'd better head out.",
        "You haven't been practicing enough. All that time you waste chasing after women would be better spent training. I'll train with you anytime. So just... Hm? What's that strange look for?",
        "I know what you mean. It's probably because we've been friends for so long.",
        "Absolutely. No matter what happens, we'll always be friends, Sylvain.",
        "No, I'm headed to town to buy supplies, but I'll be training after that, naturally. Why?",
        "Of course it hasn't. I am as I ever was.",
        "You're being weird. Have you always been this weird, and I just never noticed?",
        "Don't be ridiculous. What are you even bumbling on about?",
        "Oh, you must be referring to the makeup. It's not a big deal or anything. Just experimenting. I'm still learning. Did I mess something up?",
        "Very funny. But I must say, I'm a bit surprised. It's unlike you to stumble over yourself this much.",
        "Why what? Why I'm wearing makeup?",
        "Wow. Way to make assumptions.",
        "Don't make me hurt you.",
        "Beautiful, huh?",
        "Nightfall already? Suppose I'd better wrap up...",
        "Whoa, Mercedes? Hi? Hello. How long have you been, um- Thank you!",
        "That long? Huh. Well, my apologies for not having noticed you. I get so caught up in training, you know. But why are you here? I can't imagine it was too terribly interesting watching me.",
        "Graceful? I wouldn't say that, but thank you. If I'm to be honest, I'm the one who admires you.",
        "You're always so put together- you hold yourself with such poise and have such a keen eye for fashion. I mean, even the handkerchief you handed me smells like...lavender, is it? It's just lovely.",
        "Even the fact that you thought to put perfume on your handkerchief is delightfully foreign to me. I'd never have thought of that.",
        "Ah, that sounds really nice, yes. Sipping tea and having a chat- it's unlike me, but it sounds lovely.",
        "Oh, no need to trouble yourself and rearrange things for me.",
        "Hehe! All right, then!",
        "Apologies for my late arrival, Mercedes. My duties ran long, as per usual.",
        "Not entirely, no. I'm not accustomed to being treated so...delicately. Anyway, what will we talk about today?",
        "You? Gripe? Now that's unusual! I'm happy to listen, of course. It's the least I can do after all the kindness you've shown me.",
        "Oh?",
        "And will you accept?",
        "Understandably so. Sounds to me like you need a strategy to silence your father.",
        "Don't you agree? It seems the best course of action would be to consider severing all ties with the family and running away.",
        "Oh. OK. It's...just a bit personal for me, actually. My own father has brought countless marriage proposals to my attention. He always was obsessed with me carrying on the family bloodline. At a very young age, my hand had already been promised to someone in marriage. But Glenn died young.",
        "Hm. That's a good question. It's hard to imagine now. Although I did admire him quite a lot. He held true to the ideals of knighthood, proudly serving the king. Even after all these years, I aspire to be the type of knight that he embodied. But that's just it. I'm not a tool for furthering my family's fortunes. I'm a knight at heart. Regardless of what my father desires.",
        "Even though we are such different people.",
        "I do. These tea parties of ours...they really are something special.",
        "Hahaha, absolutely! I'm happy to speak with you anytime, and I want to know you better too, Mercedes.",
        "Sure, I can spare a moment or two.",
        "I haven't the time to bother with such frivolities. As long as basic hygiene is being met, then I'm happy.",
        "Um, well, thank you... I suppose I do find it all somewhat intriguing. But my time is precious to me, and my focus is on knighthood. Taking time to paint my face simply isn't a top priority.",
        "Um...well, maybe? I guess? That does sound mostly harmless...",
        "Now wait just a-",
        "I actually never agreed to start putting that stuff on my face, Annette.",
        "You're throwing it away? I can't just stand by and let something go to waste... OK. All right. Thank you. We can do this.",
        "Now, don't get carried away... Argh. She played me like a fiddle.",
        "What's the matter Annette? You look upset.",
        "I'm not sure I follow. Take a breath. What's going on?",
        "Oh, I see, I imagine they mentioned that my family was fairly poor, and they probably also mentioned that I lost my fiancé, Correct?",
        "It's perfectly fine, Annette. It's true my family struggled financially. It wasn't easy growing up, but it taught me values I wouldn't have learned otherwise. And we weren't so poor that I consider myself deprived. I'm sure my family would've bought me makeup if I wanted it. But it never mattered enough to me- not then, and not now.",
        "Never. While I acknowledge it can be fun, fussing over my outward appearance isn't an instinct of mine. When I was younger, I'd usually be found covered in dirt, bugs in my hair, and a big smile on my face. Things haven't changed too much since. Then, when my fiancé passed on, my priorities shifted even further. It reminded me of what's most important in life. Beyond that...it's hard to think of myself changing without him around to see it, even if it's something trivial like how I present myself. But talking to you has helped me realize it's OK to loosen up and enjoy those things if I want. So...thank you.",
        "More importantly... Do you notice anything different about me today?",
        "You could? Ah, that makes me happy. I was trying to apply it just how you showed me.",
        "I think there's a lot I can learn from you, Annette. You've helped me embrace a lighter side of life I quite like.",
        "Uh, shopping? But...what would we buy? That sounds so overwhelming!",
        "Well that does sound fun! I look forward to it.",
        "Raphael, what are you doing here?",
        "No, no. I meant what are you doing here? This isn't the dining hall.",
        "You know that, and yet you're stuffing your face here, rather than where it's appropriate. You're not even seated!",
        "Argh! You're missing the point! At least use a plate!",
        "I'm not proper at all! You're just downright crude. Have you no respect for yourself and your journey to knighthood? Knights must work from a very young age to be upstanding in all facets. You are making a mockery of all that we stand for! You-",
        "Disgusting! Now you've spilled gravy all over your shoes and your chin! You'd better wipe that up.",
        "This has nothing to do with me. It's what's expected of a knight!",
        "I - Wait. Th-that is not what I said!",
        "You are impossible!",
        "Oh. It's you. No, I'm not hungry.",
        "No.",
        "I just told you that wasn't it. It's nothing you can help with, anyway.",
        "Yeah, I guess that's helpful sometimes. Are you willing to listen, then?",
        "I've just received yet another letter from my father regarding a marriage arrangement with a noble family.",
        "I am the only person in House Galatea capable of carrying on our family line...of passing on a Crest...",
        "I've long understood that it would be expected of me to marry, of course.",
        "Raphael, are you even listening?",
        "Did you hear that ominous sound? Was that...thunder?",
        "I really am not hungry, but I can't say no to good food.",
        "All right, let's just eat, then. I can tell you about my struggles some other time, maybe.",
        "Eating? In the dining hall? You?!",
        "If only the old version of you could hear you say that. It seems to me you've taken more care with your appearance of late too. For once, you aren't covered in gravy and oil from head to toe. I'm impressed!",
        "All right, what have you done with Raphael?",
        "You've certainly become more knightly than before. But there's plenty yet to do to become a proper knight. It's not as simple as eating where you're meant to and not being covered in gravy.",
        "Uh... What does that have to do with anything?",
        "That woul be quite the undertaking for me. Listen, Raphael...that's sweet of you. However, as I've said before, I've no intention to marry. Let's cast aside this talk of marriage and instead embolden one another to be the best knights we can be!",
        "While you're working to be more proper, I'll be working to strengthen myself, that I might become a greater knight than you!",
        "Thank you, Raphael. That means a lot to me.",
        "Hey, Ignatz, what are you doing here?",
        "Uh, hello? Oh! You're painting.",
        "I could ask you the same! I...did ask you the same. Anyway, I'm just visiting the cathedral. I must say, that painting is looking wonderful!",
        "Why not? It really looks great.",
        "I wouldn't lie. Let me have a look. Oh, it's the statue of Saint Seiros.",
        "Of course not. My feelings aren't hurt so easily. Hmm, what if you gave her a more edgy outfit? Shorten up her skirt or something?",
        "Ooh, and how about making her sword bigger? Oh! Oh! Turn her into a valiant knight!",
        "Aw, come on. Just this once?",
        "Huh...She doesn't exactly look like a knight. More like a maniacal demigod...",
        "It's...different. Not quite how I envisioned.",
        "I'm sorry I pushed you, Ignatz. I'll leave you be.",
        "Good day, Ignatz! So, painting again?",
        "Look... I'm really sorry about last time. It's my fault it turned out so...well, different.",
        "That's kind of you to say but no need to pull punches.",
        "Ignatz, I appreciate your attitude, but...",
        "There are times when it's OK to feel upset or angry. If you're feeling that way, it's always best to be honest.",
        "I understand the weight of what I did. I besmirched a sacred image - and it was a painting you were pouring your heart into. I got carried away, but I'd prefer if you had told me then and there that my request was uncalled for.",
        "Why are you apologizing? I'm the one apologizing!",
        "Stop saying sorry! Ugh, never mind. Forgive me. I came here to apologize and now I'm being sharp with you...",
        "I never intended to be such a bother. I think I'll leave you to it.",
        "Oh! Uh, hi! I see you spotted me-um, saw me. I don't want to disturb you.",
        "Oh, that's wonderful. May I see?",
        "Whoa. She looks so different from the other painting. Much more divine and gentle.",
        "Not at all! She really does! She has a glowing vibrancy to her. Looking at this painting, I feel so inspired.",
        "Really? Actually, now that I look closer, I see her sword is rather large. And she seems to be in a battle stance!",
        "I'm sorry about that.",
        "If that's true, I'm very glad I could help.",
        "Exactly! Thank you, Ignatz. You've reminded me of a very valuable lesson. I'm going to strive to be more attentive and listen to other people's ideas.",
        "I can't wait to see it. I bet it'll be a masterpiece!",
        "Always diligently working on your craft.",
        "Only just now. Oh! Is that the new painting you were mentioning? You sounded especially inspired about this one. May I see?",
        "But...we had spoken about how much your perspective can broaden when you let other people in on your work. Had a change of heart?",
        "Come on-you know you don't need to feel embarrassed around me. Please, show me!",
        "This one is even more beautiful than the last! A knight in shimmering armor, fighting in all her glory! That lance looks a lot like mine! And the armor... and the horse... Um, Ignatz... Is...that...",
        "The woman in this image—she's so powerful and regal... I'm in awe. So elegant and refined, but with such a soft air, despite the armor and weaponry...",
        "Thank you, Ignatz. I'm deeply touched. And also embarrassed.",
        "Truly. I'm so moved. I guess now I really need to live up to all your painting encompasses! Please show it to me once it's finished.",
        "Oh! Seteth! You seem to have caught me when I thought nobody was around.",
        "I wouldn't want to bother you with my trivialities.",
        "That's true. It's regarding my father.",
        "Well. you have likely heard that House Galatea's financial situation is precarious. Many regions of Faerghus are harsh and infertile, but our lands especially so. There were several years of fruitless harvests— it nearly ruined us. We could barely feed our troops. Then I was born bearing a Crest, after generations bore none. Suddenly my family hung its future on me. My father had hopes that with my Crest, I'd be married into a noble family and that House Galatea's financial troubles would be a thing of the past.",
        "I beg your pardon?",
        "You truly think so? But you're so devoted to the goddess. I'm surprised to hear you say such a thing.",
        "I agree. Thank you for listening.",
        "Thank you so much!",
        "Yes, that's him. He and I have parted ways now. House Galatea was financially unstable for a long time. We were hardly able to support our soldiers and their steeds... My father had hopes that with my Crest, I'd be married into a noble family and that House Galatea's financial troubles would be a thing of the past.",
        "That was certainly the idea. But I broke ties with them. I do wonder how they are doing back home...",
        "I beg your pardon?",
        "You truly think so? But you're so devoted to the goddess. I'm surprised to hear you say such a thing.",
        "I agree. Thank you for listening.",
        "Thank you so much!",
        "Of course! They were the heroes who struck down evil with the power of the sacred weapons, protecting our land and people. Their strength was passed down through the ages, manifesting itself in the Crests some of us are born with.",
        "I imagine you ask because they later fought amongst themselves, turning on one another, ravaging the land.",
        "Yes, I agree.",
        "Yes? What of it?",
        "That's what I think too. Having a Crest or not has no bearing on your worth as a person.",
        "Thank you for your counsel and wisdom, Seteth. I've been thinking a lot lately about what might happen after the war. Father's hopes were dashed long ago... I will take some time to reflect on what lies ahead—my future.",
        "Without so much as a word, you've read me through and through.Since last we spoke, I've been thinking a lot about my future. How I want to spend my life. It's a lot to think about, and I haven't entirely sorted out where I'm going. I think I need more time to grow.",
        "You're impressed with me?",
        "Of course.",
        "Hmm...",
        "Seteth, I...",
        "I've no intention of doing such a thing. It will take me time and experience, but I will find my path and walk it proudly.",
        "Seteth! Do you have a moment?",
        "I think so. I was hoping I might ask for your opinion on the subject.",
        "I want to serve as a knight and protect my homeland. I know this, through and through. It has been my truth for as long as I can remember. However, I feel that I should choose a path that would benefit my father. I was raised by him in a happy home, never wanting for anything, despite my family's meager finances. I owe it to him to choose a path he'd approve of.",
        "Please, go ahead.",
        "I have not. There hasn't been time to pay him a visit. He did permit me to join this war... But I was brash about my departure. I...I left forcibly.",
        "Perhaps. My father is an obstinate man. At this point, I'm not sure he'd care to hear what I have to say.",
        "Seteth... Thank you. You're right. I should talk to him. I've spent so much time thinking about how stubborn he is that I've neglected to acknowledge my own part in all this. Rather than blaming him, I need to recognize how stubborn I myself have been. Maybe if I open up and allow for vulnerability, he will too...",
        "I will! And I will keep your words close to my heart. Thank you for everything, Seteth.",
        "Phew! Good work. Should we call it a day?",
        "Catherine? If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you something.",
        "When I expect an attack from above, you surprise me from below. When I expect a jab, I get a sweep! You seem to anticipate my anticipation.",
        "You're reading my movements and trying to calculate what I'll do next. That has always seemed the most sound strategy when engaging in combat, yes.",
        "Your dedication to Lady Rhea's safety is truly inspiring, Catherine.",
        "My dream is to become a knight and protect my king, no matter the cost. There is no greater purpose I can serve. Although your fealty is sworn to Lady Rhea, you are the ideal knight I aspire to be.",
        "Catherine, I'd be honored if you would make me your squire.",
        "However you might judge me, I'm quite serious about this.",
        "Pardon me? Uh...that can't possibly be where you want to start...",
        "Ah. Understood!",
        "Yes, that should suffice!",
        "I've made it my goal to read your aim and not give away anything through my body language.",
        "Have you ever needed to employ such methods?",
        "Hahaha! Haha!",
        "I'm prepared to do whatever is requested of me. Come what may. I will be a knight who loyally serves my king, just as you loyally serve Lady Rhea.",
        "You're right—it does sound like a contradiction. With all due respect, that isn't very knightly of you. I'm not sure I fully understand...",

If it weren't for him, you wouldn't be half the person you are now. You've probably never even thought about how lucky you are. Ugh! OK, this really bothers me! Listen up. I don't care if you're the teacher and I'm the student. I'm going to outshine you. I know you were some famous mercenary before you came here, but let me tell you something... I'm going to be better than you ever were! In fact, I'll surpass you in no time at all, so don't blink. You might miss it.",
        "Hey, Professor. Got a minute? Look, I'm sorry I snapped at you. I didn't mean to lose my temper. I was rude to you. I should have known better.",

        "Huh. Maybe he left you with a relative or something. Anyway, back then, Jeralt's job was to deal with poachers—well, they were bandits—but we called them poachers. Nobody in the village could stand up to them. But your dad? He took them on like it was nothing. I was so impressed! All I could think was how amazing mercenaries were. I'd lived in that tiny village my whole life, so to me, Captain Jeralt was nothing short of a legend. So I went right up to him, and I told him I was going to be his apprentice. He didn't stick around long after that, but he did teach me a lot while he was with us. Tactics, strategy, training routines—it was all so new and exciting! So after he left, I kept at it. Kept training. Just like he taught me.",
        "Me too. I always planned to meet him again, once I became a top-tier mercenary. But I'm just glad I got to see him. To thank him properly and all. I've spent my whole life working to become a great mercenary like your father. There were so many times when I wanted to ask his advice, but I couldn't. I just had to make do. That's how I've made it this far. Just hard work, all on my own. But then you come along... And it's like you don't appreciate Captain Jeralt at all, or how lucky you were to have him around your whole life! Ugh! It still really bothers me! You might be his kid, but I'm still his best apprentice! Got it?!",

        "Captain Jeralt said that, if anything should happen to him, I'd have to support you in his place. He didn't sound serious at the time, but it was right before he...you know. Before we lost him. So, I've decided. I'd like to do just what he said. I know I'm not as strong as I need to be. But I swear to you...I'll train until I am. What do you say? Can I call you my employer?",

        "That the war's finally over. And that his kid and his greatest apprentice did an amazing job out there! Haha, maybe I'm overselling the part I played.",
        "Thanks, but I was nothing compared to you. I feel like an idiot for ever thinking I could surpass you. I have managed to keep my promise though. So, how would you feel about hiring me again? Can't exactly go and break my word now, can I?",
        "The war's over, but the enemy might still be lurking! What if they're waiting until I'm gone to attack you?!",
        "But— Oh, I get it. You're probably pretty tired of me always trailing after you, huh?",
        "Love?! As in... As in the way a commander loves his soldiers, right? Of course that's what you mean... Oh, that's...that kind of love! Can this really be happening? You want to marry me?... I... Of course will! You are being serious, right? That would be an awful joke... I'm sorry. I should have been honest. All that stuff about my promise a minute ago, it was mostly just an excuse for wanting to be near you. But, I'm not really the romantic type, so I had a hard time coming out and saying it. Are you sure this is what you want though? I know I'm not exactly conventional. Guess I'm really wearing this ring, then aren't I? But, I do still have a promise to keep with Captain Jeralt too.",
        "Phew... Oh, Professor! Are you training too? I was just about to finish up, but if you want to join in, I can stick around a while longer.",

        "Really? To be honest, I don't really trust my own ability to read people. I like to look for the good in them, but that doesn't mean it's really there. I mean, you seem like a good person, but your heart could be black for all I know.",
        "I'll keep that in mind. Though, I'm not sure I should be taking advice from someone covered in dish suds.",

        "True. Not many hunters around the monastery, huh? Rivers full of fish, trees bursting with fruit, mushrooms ready to harvest all over... It's the kind of place where you can really be self-sufficient. Guess we can thank the goddess for that.",
        "Not a very noble-sounding thing, to disregard the goddess and honor the land.",
        "Won't hear me deny it. But who's to say it isn't the goddess whose protection makes nature thrive? I'm not the most devout person, but I'm not about to go around saying we don't need the goddess at all.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Hey, it's fine. You don't have to worry about me. I'm a believer, but I know there are those who aren't. And I kind of like your way of thinking—giving thanks to nature and all. It makes sense.",
        "What, like I'm feral or something?",
        "Yeah, probably. We'll just have to keep it to ourselves.",
        "Well, we've got another battle coming up. What do you think of our chances?",
        "That's the right attitude. I'm sure they're doing all they can on their side too.",
        "Guess you're right. Thinking about it like that, even this war seems like a storm in a teacup.",
        "Haha, typical laid-back Claude. I always like talking to you. Your perspective on the world is so refreshing. Things I thought were obvious turn out not to be.",
        "True enough, but where did you get these ideas? That perspective of looking past the walls of Fódlan, when it's all we can see in front of us?",
        "I do.",
        "Show me? Are we going somewhere?",
        "Sounds eye-opening. I'll look forward to it. Can we call it a promise?",
        "Perfect. The soil's ready. Let's get to planting.",
        "There we go, all set. Now, a little water.",
        "Hey, Bernadetta. What are you doing here?",
        "Hm? What is it?",
        "If you've got time to stare, you may as well help me out. Is that all you wanted to say?",
        "Well, come on. Out with it.",
        "Your elbow looks fine to me. Is it bothering you?",
        "Huh, how about that? You're right. I didn't notice. You could have just told me right away, you know. It's just a little tear though. Nothing to worry about.",
        "You can do that?",
        "I never knew. Well, if you're offering, by all means! Just let me finish watering these. Oh, I guess I should get this shirt off first though, huh?",
        "Hey, thanks! You've helped me a lot lately. I feel like I should be doing this stuff myself. But ever since you patched up my sleeve, I've been really interested in your craft.",
        "Yeah. When I saw what you were doing, I thought, \"What the heck is that?\" But it turned out to be a nice touch, once I was actually wearing it. Practical too. When you're embroidering, you patch up the torn parts with new cloth, right? And that strengthens it, so the same part won't break so easily next time.",
        "Haha, sorry. I should have told you I liked it. Thanks, Bernadetta. I'm glad I asked for your help.",
        "What'd you make this time? A hornet, huh? You do like the scary critters, don't you?",
        "I sting like a hornet, do I? Actually, I like that. You know, you ought to be more confident.",
        "You're good enough at sewing that you could make a living out of it. You should take pride in that.",
        "That's not true at all. You've been a great help! Maybe I'm a better fighter, but I've got nowhere near the same skill in sewing. We can help each other. Isn't that what friends do?",
        "Hey, come on! I know you're not the most confident, but this is getting silly. Of course we're friends. I completely trust you.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Right — for sure. But I wasn't just talking about embroidery, you know.",
        "Finally spotted me, did you?",
        "They say you're the best. I wanted to see your training with my own eyes.",
        "Enough to see how to beat you, at least.",
        "That's right. See, I was trained by...",
        "So you know.",
        "I'm ready if you are.",
        "Sounds good. When?",
        "Oh, don't worry. I'll be ready.",
        "Sorry to keep you waiting.",
        "I did just say sorry, but I could say the same to you. You were pretty slow to settle on a time.",
        "We could go back and forth like this all day. Or we could get started.",
        "On my signal?",
        "That's better. OK, go!",
        "That's right! How you feelin' down there?",
        "Say what you want, but Captain Jeralt taught me this one! Whew! You're heavier than you look.",
        "If this were for real, you'd be dead. Aren't you glad I put straw down there, instead of spikes?",
        "You're not wrong. I did it to rile you up...draw you in. You're capable, confident... I was counting on that. So, what do you think about Captain Jeralt's training now?",
        "Seeing as you're thanking me, can I ask you for a favor? Will you come watch my next training session? I'd like a few pointers about fighting in close quarters.",
        "You will? Thanks!",
        "Good to know. There are so many differences between bows and blades!",
        "Must be Captain Jeralt's influence. The weather, the terrain, the enemy's feelings—you have to find ways to make it all work for you.",
        "For a girl? Come on, you're past that. Looking down on your opponent is a great way to fall into a pit trap, isn't it?",
        "Glad you remember.",
        "Count on it! We'll come up with plenty of new ideas if we work together. Guess that means we're partners, doesn't it?",
        "Partners! Friends who help each other improve!",
        "Not at all! Looking forward to working with you, partner!",
        "Hi.",
        "Hey. Hey! Get back here!",
        "You chat up all the girls like that, don't you?",
        "Now, hold on! How come it's not rude for you to just pass me by?!",
        "Look at me! I'm a girl, you know!",
        "Uh, hang on, back up. Don't get the wrong idea.",
        "What did you just call me?",
        "Hey! Acting pitiful won't get you anywhere! I won't just forget about this, you know!",
        "Hey.",
        "Uh, I just came to the greenhouse to look at flowers. What's with you?",
        "Could you cut the weird metaphors and just say what you want to say? Oh, wait. I get it. I'm not ladylike enough to fit in with all the pretty flowers.",
        "This is a joke, right? Tell me this is a joke.",
        "Is that right?",
        "Look, can you just...go back to normal?",
        "Why are you suddenly not capable of carrying on a normal conversation?",
        "You can quit messing with me at any time.",
        "Would you stop? This is getting weird.",
        "Right. Bye.",
        "Charming? Me, of all people? Like I'd actually believe that.",
        "'''' Stupid.",
        "Hey, Lorenz. Got a minute?",
        "Doing great! I found a load of old weapons. Just got done hauling them out of storage.",
        "They might only be good for training, but with a little care, who knows? Here, have some oil.",
        "Like I said, they need a little care. With a bit of maintenance, some of these will really shine!",
        "It's for polishing, Lorenz. Don't tell me you've never polished a weapon before.",
        "In that case, appraise while you polish. You're bound to find something good, working through these.",
        "I'm not ordering you around. And I'm not talking to you as a noble either. I'm asking you to help me with this. As a friend.",
        "Oh, good! Let's get to it, then, buddy!",
        "Yep. Lots to do, not like you fancy nobles. Hey, can't you see all this stuff I'm carrying? Come on, move over already.",
        "Can't even ask a noble to step to the side, huh? That's a joke, right? You're kidding?",
        "What?!",
        "Hey, cut that out! Isn't that improper or something, bowing to a commoner?",
        "That's not what it'll look like. Hey, it's fine! Leave it!",
        "That's a real pretty way to talk about sitting in castles doing nothing. Let me tell you, everyone in my village is so grateful to be taxed up to the eyeballs for the privilege of— ow!",
        "What, you just carry that stuff around with you?",
        "I don't get you, Lorenz.",
        "What, that fancy thing? Bit of a waste, isn't it? Hey, no thanks! I don't need some noble's pity!",
        "More of your weird logic.",
        "I really don't understand that guy. Oh no — I completely forgot to thank him!",
        "Hey. Got a minute?",
        "No, I came to give you this handkerchief back. Sorry, I know I held onto it for a while.",
        "You lent me this. Remember?",
        "That's nice. But you left out the part where the nobles take all the stuff the regular folks make.",
        "Sauin? That's... My village. You knew?",
        "So that's what brought Jeralt...",
        "Nothing. Look, just take the handkerchief. I'm returning something I borrowed from a friend.",
        "You know, I really wish you wouldn't think of nobles as only giving and commoners as only receiving. Friends help each other, without thinking about status. And that help goes both ways.",
        "Huh. I always thought he was just stuck-up. Turns out, he just has this grand idea of nobility he's trying to live up to. Oh no! I didn't even give him the handkerchief!",
        "One mistake like that in battle and you're done. This is your weapon hand, isn't it? Let me stop the blood.",
        "No trouble. And no apologies. \"Thanks\" is what you say when a friend helps you out. Ah, darn...",
        "I need a bandage to stop the bleeding, but this is all I've got.",
        "I was only carrying it around to give back to you, anyway. Mind if I use it for this?",
        "'''' I guess so. Not that I'm happy you're bleeding. I'm glad you'll accept it though. In the past, you might have refused it.",
        "I didn't understand why you were so strict about it, but I think I kind of get it now. You know, if every noble were like you, the world would be a better place.",
        "Me?",
        "No need for vows. That's how I've always seen it. You weren't wrong about nobles and commoners each having their own roles. But the important thing is we help each other.",
        "Huh? Sorry, what did you say?",
        "Oh, this? Ha... I thought I'd get all my chores done at once. Guess it got a little out of hand. Sorry to be a pain, but could you help me out?",
        "Well, first it was just the cloth scraps from the tailor, then it was the used oil from a restaurant in town... After that, it was the books the scholars didn't know what to do with. I mean, that was just on the way.",
        "It wasn't so bad! I just figured it would save time if I did it all in one trip.",
        "The scraps will be good for dish cloths, and I can make soap from the oil. The books are just to help with my studies.",
        "Nope. Can't stand the idea.",
        "I cook to relax. And it's nice to see how enthusiastic you get about eating what I make. Whatever I give away is just the stuff that isn't useful to me. I pick up all sorts of things when I'm in town. Giving things like that to people who need them, or who actually use them, makes sure they aren't wasted.",
        "I guess things were tough, now that you mention it. The folks in my village definitely aren't rich. My dad had to go through a lot of trouble to get the recommendations I needed to go to the academy. That doesn't mean I've grown up to be stingy. It just means I don't like to squander. Anyway, enough of that. It's in poor taste to go on about your own hardships. I've always got time for a meal with a friend. And it just so happens I've picked up some choice meat today. Why don't we share it?",
        "Oh, it's Raphael. What's he doing at that desk?",
        "Hey! Are you studying? I thought you'd given up on it. Nice to see you're...",
        "What the?!",
        "What's wrong? Why are you crying?",
        "Okay, maybe start from the beginning.",
        "You might have to back up a bit more before this starts to makes sense to me.",
        "That's really tough. Hard to make a fortune with just your strength, I'm sure.",
        "Wow. That's a lot of pressure.",
        "She sounds like a great kid. So, what did the letter say?",
        "That's good, right? Wait... Where did you find extras?",
        "Um, don't take this the wrong way, but don't think you've still got things to learn? Well, I guess if it makes her happy, it's worth it. Maybe I can scrounge up something for her too.",
        "Hey! Writing to your sister again?",
        "You had one last week too. It's good to see you're both so good about staying in touch. It's especially important when there's a war going on.",
        "Good. I'm glad gathering those pigments paid off.",
        "I was fascinated with painting at that age. I was a pretty artistic kid, if you can believe it. Not a lot of time for it when you're hungry, though.",
        "I guess so. We never thought of it that way. But it's true the children in my village don't usually get to choose their futures. Any one of us could have had the talent for artistic genius and never even noticed. I was one of the lucky ones. I only got to follow my passion thanks to my father and all the other folks. That's why, once I come into my own, the first thing I'll do is head back there and help the other kids.",
        "Haha, no need to exaggerate it. Besides, it's not like I'm unique. You're working hard for your sister's future, aren't you?",
        "Huh?",
        "It's... probably a good thing you didn't try to take on your family's business. If you take half of my burden, and I take half of yours, the total's still the same.",
        "Haha, on second thought, you might be right. With that attitude, and the right partner to share the burden, maybe it is only half the weight.",
        "That's true. And I do hate waste, as you well know. So when it comes to working toward the future you're after, I won't fall short.",
        "Deal!",
        "Hey, Ignatz! Didn't you have something to talk to the professor about?",
        "Come on, do I seem like the type to do that? No, I just had a couple of questions about the bows. We're done now, so I thought I'd come and tell you.",
        "Lots of them have come in for repairs lately, so I switched out some of the strings for stronger ones. They've been breaking less, but now they're harder to draw.",
        "Maybe. If the only issue was draw weight, I'd just tell people to get stronger arms. But the real problem is that you can't shoot as fast. Arrows also fly too far now.",
        "Sure, on open plains. But up close, you lose accuracy. That's why I thought it might be good to use different bowstrings for different scenarios. I wanted the professor's opinion about that.",
        "Guess I do. I grew up in a hunting village, so I've been around them my whole life. I wouldn't say I'm necessarily better than anyone, but at least I know what I'm doing. And you? Do you have something you're really good at?",
        "Well, I'm sure you'll find your thing someday.",
        "Hngh... Who's there? Oh. Hey, Ignatz.",
        "Relax. You're not interrupting.",
        "I sometimes come here to practice by myself. It's more like a real battlefield, you know? Shooting the targets in the yard lets you train your aim and all, but the tension just isn't the same.",
        "Oh, knock it off. You're already here. May as well stick around while I catch my breath.",
        "You know you've said you're sorry about a dozen times since you got here?",
        "It's fine. I guess it's part of your charm. Hey, what's that bundle of papers? Oh, did you come here to paint? I remember now! Someone said you're a great artist. You paint a lot, right?",
        "Ah! Well, that could be your thing.",
        "Last time we talked about it, you said you didn't have a thing you were really amazing at. But if you like painting so much, it must be a skill you're looking to master.",
        "So, you're practicing your art to make other people happy? Is that it?",
        "Aren't you from a merchant family employed by the nobles? I'd think it would be really useful there.",
        "Oh, Ignatz...",
        "Already done. What about you? Off to draw?",
        "Come to think of it, I've still never seen your work. Here, let me take a peek.",
        "Oh, lighten up!",
        "Wow! Look at all that paper! Are these all drawings? What should I look at first?",
        "Yeah. You'd think there'd be only one way to do stuff like engraving, but it actually varies a lot.",
        "Oh, here's a landscape. What a bright blue sky! You really make it seem alive.",
        "Listen, Ignatz. You need to become a painter.",
        "Don't say it's not useful. Your talent moves people. Someday, I'm sure your art will save someone's life.",
        "Remember that girl you told me about? You made her so happy. And you were only just starting out. Think about what you could do now that you've had so much practice! This is your calling.",
        "Yeah! It's something you can do that no one else can. I envy you. I wish I had a gift like that. So stop apologizing for your talent and just do it!",
        "Hey Ignatz! Drawing again?",
        "Like I said, it's your calling. Don't feel bad about it.",
        "More just double-checking this bowstring. I want to make sure it's ready for the next battle.",
        "That's the spirit! Does that mean you've finally accepted that you're an artist?",
        "Good point! I'm glad you've got some confidence.",
        "Me? I'm going to become a top-tier mercenary.",
        "Even after the war's over, there'll be plenty of work for me to do before peace really takes hold. I'll pay what I owe my village back, with interest. After that, I don't know. Never thought about it.",
        "Hardly. Lots of options just don't suit me. I mean, could you imagine me as a songstress? But yeah, I don't know. Once I've paid off my debts, I guess I'll just have to find something new.",
        "Travel, huh? There's an idea. Wanna come with?",
        "Sure. You were really excited about different styles across the world, weren't you? Don't you want more of that? Maybe even see the sky in a new shade?",
        "If your parents object, we'll just say I kidnapped you. Actually, feel free to say that, even if you go alone.",
        "Hey, hold on! What's this all of a sudden?",
        "Haha! You're hilarious, Ignatz. There's never a dull moment with you around.",
        "Whoa! Lysithea? You're really pale!",
        "Can you even make it there in that state? Here, climb on my back. I'll carry you.",
        "Always worried about looking like a kid. No time for that now. Just get on!",
        "No, not at all. Actually made for a fun bit of training.",
        "Yeah. Carrying someone around is good for the legs. You're just the right weight for it too. I might ask you to help me train again sometime! Anything can be a kind of training with the right attitude, you know?",
        "Well, I can't devote all my time purely to training. So it's more efficient if I can train while I get other stuff done at the same time.",
        "Huh? What do you mean?",
        "Come to think of it, you do always seem to stick to a pretty rigid schedule, don't you? I've noticed that you focus completely on whatever it is you've set out to do. Then you switch to something else, and focus completely on that.",
        "Now that I think about it, you may be right. Maybe that is the more efficient way to do things. Hey, you're really bright. Lysithea! Thanks so much for the helpful advice!",
        "Hey, I'm about to take out the trash. Got anything you want me to take?",
        "Wow, that's quite the pile there. You sure it's all fine to throw away?",
        "Why am I not surprised? I wish I had even half your power of concentration. OK, here we go. Ugh...this is pretty heavy! Well, it'll be a good workout. Oh, but you were telling me not to take my training so lightly. Still, can't hurt to get a little exercise in. I'll just take it at a run. See you later!",
        "Hm? What is it, Lysithea? Was there something in that pile of paper you wanted to hang on to, after all?",
        "Well, sure. But, if everyone has their own methods, then your methods aren't wrong either. All you did was share with me, so there's no need for apologies. Still, it's probably me to imitate your levels of focus and concentration. How do you even manage to throw yourself into only one thing like that?",
        "I can understand that. I'm sort of the same way. I hate feeling like I'm not getting enough work done. Anyway, you should just do what works for you. You've got something you want to achieve, right? That's why you feel pressured to study so hard.",
        "Then focus on what matters to you. Leave the rest to people who have the time for it. And hey, if you need any heavy lifting done, you know where to go! The way I see it, it's all training.",
        "Whoa. What's with the compliments all of a sudden?",
        "Wait?",
        "Ha, you're making me blush! What a strange way to compliment someone.",
        "Hey, Marianne! What are you up to?",
        "Really? I was sure I heard you talking to someone.",
        "By the way, are you free right now?",
        "I was about to go buy towels and soap, but the girls saddled me with all these specific requests. They want it all to look cute, or to smell a certain way, but all that's just nonsense to me. I've always made my own towels out of old scraps, and soap from used cooking oil. I've never given it much thought beyond that.",
        "But I've noticed you've got some really nice things. So, you have an eye for that stuff, right? Obviously I'd give you all the credit. And I'm sure everyone would be really grateful for your help.",
        "Really? I don't think that's true. Come on, you'll be doing me a big favor.",
        "That's nonsense! You've got to get some fresh air now and again.",
        "Are you serious?",
        "Now hold on just a second. You'll cause me misfortune? What kind of backwards talk is that?! If you really don't want me around, then at least come out and say it straight! I'm sorry for the unwelcome invitation. Don't worry, I won't make the same mistake again.",
        "...Oh. Hey, Marianne.",
        "I thought greenhouse duty was mine today. What are you doing here?",
        "You've been avoiding me ever since I lost my temper, haven't you? You're probably scared of me now. In the moment, I was hurt. I'm sure you had good reasons to act the way you did. If you want me to leave you alone, I will. I promise, you've got nothing to fear from me.",
        "I've watered all the plants, so I'm done here. I'll get out of your way.",
        "Huh? Hey, what is it?",
        "No, not at all. Thanks for keeping me. Honestly, I've been worried about you. If you ever want to talk, about anything, just say so. I'll make time.",
        "I know it's hard. You've been through a lot, but it's worth the extra effort to talk to your friends.",
        "Hey, we're having one right now. And I'm telling you, I'm not uncomfortable. I'm actually really happy. So don't worry about me. And it's OK to be quiet sometimes, but try to find a middle ground, at least. Otherwise, you'll never get any better.",
        "As far as what to talk about, anything's good. Hobbies, things you like, a dream you had last night... Really, anything.",
        "I think so too! Did you know that, where I come from, those have a completely different color?",
        "Great! Come visit my village someday. In fact, we should invite all of our friends. It'll be fun!",
        "Ha! Yah!",
        "Hey, what are you doing? That's mine!",
        "I usually wear it around my neck, but I put it down while I'm training so I don't get sweat all over it.",
        "It's a good luck charm. If I don't keep it close by, then what's the point?",
        "Captain Jeralt gave it to me when I was a kid.",
        "Thanks, but Captain Jeralt made it especially for me. I'd really rather keep it just as it is.",
        "I'm sure you would. But Captain Jeralt didn't treat me as some young girl. He treated me like a person who mattered. An equal. He taught me everything. I don't want to forget his teachings, so I'm going to keep this charm just the way it is.",
        "Hey Hilda. You said you wanted to talk? Whoa, what's with all these expensive necklaces? Why do you have them all laid out like that?",
        "Huh? Why would you do that?",
        "I'm not gonna accept a gift like that without a reason. Even with a reason, I'd probably decline.",
        "Maybe for you.",
        "Because for me, those are just fancy decorations. Take this one, for example. How'd you come by it?",
        "That's the kind of thing I'm talking about. The sentimental value of each one. These necklaces are nice and all, but I don't have any special feelings or memories about any of them. But this charm, it's packed with things I don't want to forget. Captain Jeralt's teachings, and a lot of memories too. Even if, to you, it's just a dirty hunk of wood.",
        "Like I care about that.",
        "Make a charm for me? You'd do that?",
        "Sure! I can't just accept a gift for nothing though. I'll make one for you, too, if you'll teach me how! And I'll put plenty of feeling into it, so when we exchange them, it will really mean something.",
        "I'll... See what I can do.",
        "Oh! Hello, Seteth.",
        "Yeah, this is a great spot for it. You must be a pretty experienced fisherman, huh?",
        "Now that you mention it, I can see that you're not having much luck today.",
        "Well, that explains it! But why bother fishing at all, if you're not even trying to catch something?",
        "Oh, that makes sense. Still, if you're going to go to all the trouble, you may as well actually bait the line.",
        "Ah. And your wife, where is she now?",
        "Me? Just for the fish, actually. For me, it's purely practical. Catch a bite now, one less meal to worry about later. Hunting, fishing... Whatever it takes to get by. That's how I've always done it. I'm not exactly starving right now, but back then, if I couldn't catch something, I'd go hungry. So getting the hang of it was pretty vital.",
        "Probably, yeah. The need makes it more purposeful. But hey, if you ever want to try fishing for real, I'd be happy to share my bait with you. And if you catch something, I'll cook it up nicely for you. How's that for motivation?",
        "Can't promise it'll be fancy, but it'll taste good.",
        "Great! Let's get started!",
        "Hello again, Seteth. Oh, full basket! Big catch?",
        "Even so, that's quite the haul!",
        "Oh. Yeah?",
        "Well, it's only natural. Seeing what you've already got just makes you curious how far you can take it.",
        "Don't mention it. Actually, I should thank you too.",
        "Yeah. Used to be, I only ever fished for food. Lately, though, I've been coming here just to relax. I do still eat the fish, of course, but I appreciate fishing in a whole new way now.",
        "I'd only planned to take it easy, but seeing all you've caught has definitely me hungry.",
        "Hey, thanks! In that case, why don't we eat together? You can leave all the cooking to me!",
        "Today was a great day for fishing, wasn't it?",
        "You won on size though. Some of these fish are huge! And it was you who caught this beauty.",
        "It's a little bland, but it's not bad. You just need to fry it in oil to bring the flavor out. There are lots of little bones, too, so you need to be careful eating it.",
        "Happily! You know, once this war is over, I'll be able to make even more elaborate dishes. I'm sure none of it will compare to your wife's cooking though.",
        "I'm flattered, but that doesn't seem like a good motivation to fight.",
        "I have to admit, I didn't expect that from you. You're always so serious. But I value our fishing time too. With all the chaos, it's great to have a way to relax.",
        "Hope's not enough. We need to build that future with our own hands.",
        "Don't worry, there's plenty more where that came from! Speaking of, time to handle today's haul.",
        "Alois! I was hoping you could tell me some more stories about Captain Jeralt.",
        "Can't hurt, can it? All our work for the day is done. So remind me... How did you meet him?",
        "Uh-huh. Go on.",
        "At that age, you must have had some real talent and courage to stand out as a future knight!",
        "Really? He didn't choose you for your bravery? What made him choose you, then?",
        "What? That's it?!",
        "Ha! Abrasive to the last! That's Captain Jeralt for you!",
        "Oh no, you're right! I'd better go. See you around!",
        "Hey, Alois! Tell me another story about Captain Jeralt, will you?",
        "What?! What did you do?",
        "Oh, I get it. They figured his aim would be great even while drunk.",
        "A hatchet, huh? I guess a dagger would be too easy?",
        "Ah! So he could knock it right off, huh?",
        "I knew it! That's our captain, so clumsy sometimes!",
        "Oh, so that's why? I just remember him saying his hands were no good for finesse.",
        "Really? Seems unlike him to miss that apple, then.",
        "Do you think maybe he was secretly angry with you?",
        "Ha! No way! He must have just known you would dodge the throw in time. Horsing around at the inn, deadly serious on the battlefield. Sounds just like him, doesn't it?",
        "So, that's it. I'm going to be a great mercenary just like Captain Jeralt!",
        "I know! I picked that up from him too.",
        "Why's that?",
        "No! Don't say that, you can't give up!",
        "That's — wow. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say...",
        "Of course I will. Definitely.",
        "The hatchet throwing? Sure, I remember. Why?",
        "Wait, what?! That's got nothing to do with me!",
        "Hold on! That's a joke, right?! Hey! Get back here! Take your lofty ambitions back! I don't want your stupid debts!",
        "Huhh... Huhh...",
        "Right. Thanks.",
        "No. Sorry. I'm all right.",
        "Because I can't hold my own against you. And on top of that, you have to worry about hurting me. I feel like I've let you down.",
        "Probably that I was about to keel over?",
        "I've got plenty of will.",
        "Good point.",
        "But I don't have a Crest or a Relic. How could I ever hope to beat you?",
        "Catherine's working really hard. I guess even the strongest fighters can't neglect their training.",
        "At it again. Or is she still at it?",
        "Sorry, I didn't mean anything by it! I was just passing by. I can't help but wonder, though... Have you been training all this time?",
        "I can't even imagine having what it takes to keep that up for so long.",
        "I see why you're so successful.",
        "You're right. I've been narrow-minded. I had decided, since I don't have a Crest and can't use Relics, that I'm powerless against someone like you. But that's wrong. I'm not helpless. Not as long as I'm breathing and on my feet. So, the first thing I'm going to learn is how to beat you. Unarmed, at least.",
        "Good! I hope you're ready, because I'm going to train even harder than you!",
        "We start tomorrow!",
        "Why am I so off? Yesterday wasn't like this. Some days, I just can't seem to hit anything.",
        "Now that you mention it, Shamir, how come I've never seen you train? Do you keep odd hours? Or are you just so good that you don't even need to anymore?",
        "A dagger?",
        "Wow, nice throw! That was a long one! But, does throwing knives at pillars really count as shooting practice?",
        "Is that — a centipede?! You pierced it clean in half! How did you even see that?!",
        "My daily routine, huh? That's great advice! Thanks, I'll do my best.",
        "Um, hi, Shamir. What have you heard, exactly?",
        "I'm sorry! Idiotic's a bit hard though, isn't it?",
        "I know. Everyone was pretty mad. I'm really am sorry.",
        "My mentor used to do that kind of thing a lot.",
        "Would and did. Mostly when he was drunk, though.",
        "But, um, I don't... Really like bugs.",
        "I just can't look at them. Seeing all the extra legs, and things. Ugh! Makes my skin crawl.",
        "You want me to draw spiders?! Ew, no! Would that even help?",
        "Huh? You were scared of them too?",
        "Okay, you've talked me into it. I'll give it a try.",
        "Got it! Got it. Learned my lesson. Promise.",
        "Guess that's enough for now.",
        "Right, about that. I've been doing everything you said, but...",
        "Not with my archery, but... I'm not getting any better at dealing with bugs. Even with all the practice, I just can't bring myself to look at a real, live spider.",
        "Sure. Here.",
        "What do you mean, what is it?! It's a spider!",
        "What's so funny?!",
        "Ridiculous?! That's what they look like, isn't it?!",
        "I just told you I can't even look at the little monsters!",
        "Oh, why did you have to be so detailed?!",
        "Ew, it's too much! I can't stand the sight of it!",
        "So, archery's secondary now, is it?",
        "When you put it that way, I guess I'll have to. Okay, Shamir, you've talked me into it. First I'll take out the drawings, and then I'll move onto the real thing!"

But if the war were to end today, we would go on living, perhaps not using the power of our Crests at all.

        "** Hello there, Edelgard. Are you looking for something?",
        "I see. Well, congratulations, you've found him. Did you want him for something in particular?",
        "Well, perhaps you're interested in hearing my latest theories on the nature of Crests. I suspect the formation of Crests may be quite different than that recorded in church tradition.",
        "Well, of course.",
        "I suspect you'll find the topic rather entertaining.",
        "What more do you need? Crest research is its own reward.",
        "Why would I busy myself with such tedious work? I perform this research for my own knowledge. I'm not interested in the world at large.",
        "I'm sure there must be some use...",
        "Well, there are people out there who spend good money on bizarre artistic creations... So I'm sure my not-at-all useful research could be used as a fine lullaby for the children of the world.",
        "Sure, of course. Good-bye.",
        "My apologies, but I cannot train right now. I have plans for later and don't wish to tire myself. Caspar invited me to train with him, you see...",
        "Not the whole debate. I closed my eyes only after I knew what reading would cover the topic.",
        "Of course not. I was sneaking out to avoid you! Ugh, how did you find me this time?",
        "Because you're an awful nuisance. Why do you pester me so?",
        "It's none of your business how I spend my time or how I use my \"talent.\" Have you assumed the role of my mother? You overplay the part! She was only half as overbearing.",
        "Fine. I'll try harder...really. I'm sure you see all this as my interfering with your duty as a leader... Have you considered how it feels for those of us who serve below you? You are a serious pain, you know.",
        "You're like a mother who insists on accompanying her son to his own knighting ceremony!",
        "No, I'd say that it's putting it lightly. All your interfering is greatly hindering my research.",
        "These structures were built more than a thousand years ago and still remain. Amazing. Most interesting, there's a pattern to the saints' emblems carved into each of the sarcophagi... Here. You'll see if you come take a look.",
        "Ugh... Let's be clear that I have my reservations, but I suppose I'll take you up on your offer...if you insist. Although, I'm unsure if it's a good idea. If my research dries up, you'll be stuck with a worthless institute. I do hope you understand that, Your Majesty.",
        "It's because all I've ever cared about is following my own curiosity...wherever it takes me. Being head of some \"institution\" and researching as part of an organized team? Sounds like no fun at all. At that point, it's not research—it's just a job, and one I've been practically forced into at that. However, since I know you've put a lot of effort into preparing this opportunity for me... And since I like you well enough, I will, begrudgingly, take you up on the offer.",
        "Of course, Your Majesty. I couldn't investigate this place freely when those of the church were around.",
        "You want me to be in charge of the thing after all, don't you?",
        "Conditions? What kind of conditions?",
        "Are you suggesting land-holding lords would have no means of applying?",
        "Do you expect anyone to be interested in such an odd position?",
        "Have you gone mad? Demanding someone rescind their land rights and then provide no compensation? Even the unlimited time off is a rather discourteous perk to offer. No one would accept room, board, and endless time to research... No one but me. Why must you...",
        "Why must you understand me so well? I asked you to consider the feelings of those below you... I never expected you to consider mine to this extent.",
        "Honestly... No woman has ever gone through this much trouble for me before.",
        "Yes, I have. I would be most pleased to accept your offer, Your Majesty.",
        "Just look at this place... It's so beautiful. I believe I should take a nap and enjoy it properly.",
        "Rest increases alertness. Is there something I can do for you, Ferdinand?",
        "Easier said than done, Ferdinand. I'm afraid I suffer from a constitution that tires easily.",
        "You're always giving it your all, aren't you?",
        "Of course not. In fact, I rather enjoy your demeanor. You go all out even when others wish you wouldn't. You work hard, inspire the admiration of others, and your dignity as a noble is beyond reproach.",
        "As capable as you are striking. Next to you, I am a mere infant.",
        "You've mastered all the important noble skills. You drink tea, talk about how great you are, ride horses...",
        "Is that so? You'll have to tell me about it sometime when I'm not walking away...",
        "I must get some sleep, being the infant that I am. Farewell for now, Ferdinand, oh noble among nobles.",
        "Observant as ever, Ferdinand. What can I help you with?",
        "It seems you really mean it this time. I suppose I have no choice but to outmatch you.",
        "Come now, Ferdinand, Don't be foolish. I can't possibly train with you... I have places to be.",
        "I... I can't... I can't run anymore.",
        "Can't we... just a minute... Ferdinand... let me... let me catch my breath.",
        "The fear... of having to exert myself really helped. You're none too slow yourself. It's been a while since I ran like that. It actually feels pretty good.",
        "After all the running you already did? That's our Ferdinand. You always give everything your all, don't you?",
        "Nothing whatsoever, Ferdinand. I mean that.",
        "I believe you have enough fighting spirit for the both of us.",
        "I'd rather pace myself. You're becoming too much like your father. I still recall with startling clarity the time he forced me to do some training.",
        "They hate one another so much. I simply cannot fathom what's wrong with the two of them.",
        "That would be rather cruel. I don't think anyone in Fódlan could beat up your father. My father does have the height advantage though...",
        "When two opponents are of similar strength, the one with the height advantage wins. It's pure math.",
        "Brute strength alone doesn't decide a fight, and taller people have longer limbs too. Longer limbs equates to a longer reach. Taller people can hit you from farther away. Oh, and they have more leg strength. There's also th- Well, I'm bored explaining this. I think you get my point.",
        "You know, I'm going to agree with you just so I don't have to keep talking.",
        "And off he goes...",
        "So it's as I said, then, isn't it? The tallest fighter has the advantage...and my father could beat yours in a fight.",
        "Is that not a waste of time? Even if I handed you a perfect strategy- something I've done in the past - you'd never follow it through.",
        "All right. I will share with you my tactical genius. I call this...my \"secret plan.\"",
        "Land the first hit. Then keep hitting them - hard and fast as you can - until they stop hitting you back.",
        "Dodge their attacks. Keep up the assault. Then go for the knees. Done.",
        "Being tall means short people are closer to your knees. Exploit the enemy's weakness, Caspar!",
        "Then go ahead and continue losing. Or...you can listen to the rest of my plan.",
        "Your defense is careless. The last bit of my secret is that you need to train in that area.",
        "No, I don't think we should -",
        "Ugh, fine. I'll train with you, but only for a bit.",
        "Uh... Ah... Caspar, please... I need... I need... Water... I need water... I'm going to... Gonna go get some. Bye.",
        "Huh? Caspar? Whatever is he doing here? Oh no... Is he looking for a fight with someone taller than him? The poor boy won't give up.",
        "Yes, Caspar, just like that! Just like we practiced! Yes! Dodge! Yes! Perfect! Right there! He's open! Punch him right in the - Yes, Caspar! You did it!",
        "I'm listening. I am sad to say, however, that the tale is slightly less thrilling the fourth time through.",
        "\"We\"?",
        "Nonsense. Your strength carried the day. I just rambled on. You're the one who did the actual work. What's really amazing is how you wouldn't give up.",
        "I should have expected that, I suppose. That's just the kind of guy you are after all. I guess this friendship is something that we can never escape from...ever.",
        "Not at all. Even if I did, our fates would not be so easily untangled.",
        "Understood. I don't desire to fight anyone anyway. This war is the last time I'll set foot on a battlefield.",
        "Let's you and I come out the other side of this war alive and well, OK? That is a promise worth making.",
        "Bernadetta?",
        "It's just me, Linhardt. What are you doing?",
        "No need for all that. I just came out here to read. I'll stay quiet and still so as not to bother you. How's that? If you want to go, that's fine too.",
        "Say, aren't you usually holed up inside?",
        "Mad? At you? Never. I rather admire you in fact. I fantasize about shutting myself in my room and never going outside again. it sounds like paradise. However, I wouldn't be able to perform my research. That, Bernadetta, is a problem.",
        "What? That's n- Ugh, this is too much hassle, I'm leaving.",
        "May I suggest vermilion instead?",
        "I said nothing about your talent. I simply suggested vermilion over crimson. Do you know vermilion? It's just a softer shade of crimson. I believe it would... Oh, forget it. This is your artistic vision, and I am but a meddler. I am going to read my book and leave you to your art.",
        "Well, I'd best be heading back.",
        "All finished?",
        "Everything looks a bit faded, doesn't it? Ironically, crimson may have been a better choice after all. The sense of distance on the petals is a little strange. Perhaps you should pay closer attention to such details as you paint. A preliminary sketch would do wonders. Still... Ah, forget my pedantic comments. You really do have potential.",
        "Bernadetta?",
        "Huh. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.",
        "I was under the impression you were going to break all of your paintbrushes.",
        "I'm just glad you're back to painting. I felt terrible about what happened last time, you know. I guess I should have kept my opinions about your painting to myself.",
        "So what do you suppose is the name for this kind of situation?",
        "Ugh... No. that's not what I meant. I'm talking about when two people are together but not together. When they're basically by themselves.",
        "Oh? Alone? Well, there it is then. I suppose you could say we're alone together. We're each here alone, yet together. So we're alone... together. What do you think?",
        "Please, Bernadetta. You shouldn't go. Being alone together means accomplishing more. We each have the concentration one gets from time alone but also the thrill of being with someone else. I find it to be an exhilarating environment. Have you felt that as well?",
        "Here's what I wish to point out about your painting... You've really improved. Your lines are bolder, your color choices more informed, and your composition as a whole...",
        "I was just... saying what I think. Look, you probably have talent, and you work hard too...",
        "I'm not sure how praising you means I'm trying to get my hooks into your heart...",
        "What a shame. I suppose I'll stop praising you, then.",
        "I don't understand you one whit. However, if you want praise, then praise you will get. You're cute.",
        "I do believe a nap is in order...",
        "Dorothea? Whatever are you doing here?",
        "You do know I am of noble birth.",
        "Each person must follow their own way. This is how I prefer to live. Even if some of the more pretentious nobles like to poke fun at my ways.",
        "What use is pride? It doesn't feed nor clothe you. It offers no warmth on a cold night.",
        "Well, most nobles are... Oh, what is the polite way to say it? Fools. yes. They are fools. As for myself... My father is the Minister of Domestic Affairs, and he has pride enough for the both of us. For example, did you know he and the Minster of Military Affairs cannot get along, although they value each other greatly? His pride gets in the way, so he can't make amends. That is why there was discord between civil ministers and military officers in the Empire. And so pride serves no good purpose in politics either. So tell me, what use is it?",
        "And how interesting is charm? It just gets in the way of living your life.",
        "Right, which means more time for napping.",
        "I suggest ignoring them.",
        "You seem less scared than surprised, but that's quibbling, I suppose. As for those two gossips? Unimportant. I suggest forgetting all about them and their petty words. Join me for a meal. I've been the target of a lot of gossip, and eating generally makes me feel better.",
        "It doesn't seem particularly difficult. Where's the problem? Is this about your pride?",
        "What then?",
        "That's fine. But your life is your own business. It's not something that can be affected by the petty words of a stranger. Ah, sorry. I kept talking, didn't I? I'll stop now.",
        "Hmm... Where has it gone?",
        "Oh, Dorothea. Are you done being alone?",
        "You have my forgiveness, although I remember no wrong doing on your part.",
        "So do you feel better?",
        "Oh? OK. What is it?",
        "Dorothea, if I may offer a bit of advice. you have no reason to fave anything you do not wish to. If the past distresses you, then just let it go. It's as simple as that.",
        "You've probably overcome a lot of tough times, haven't you? I think that's incredible, really, but why not just let go of the suffering and run away from the memories that cause you pain? I suspect you'll find it a better way of living. I know I do.",
        "Good point. Well said. Yet I propose ignoring your past changes nothing of who you are today. I see before me a great woman who should not be bothered by idle gossip. Even if you dropped everything and took a nap for thousand years, you would still be you.",
        "At least try it. Go take a nap where a noble will see you. Give them something to talk about.",
        "Watch what, Petra? Whoa! Hey, careful with that spear!",
        "Ah, you took my advice, then.",
        "I will say, the problematic maneuver seems improved at least.",
        "The spear isn't really my area of expertise, but I've seen enough training to understand the mechanics.",
        "I believe I can use that understanding to further help you improve your spearwork.",
        "Right. As I said, when you lift up and stab down, the momentum is ruined.",
        "You're trying to swing like a giant. You're not a giant, so that's a problem.",
        "So allow the spear's own momentum to do more of the hard work for you.",
        "The spear is heavy. When you lift it up high, loosen your grip a little.",
        "Precisely. When you put too much power into it, not only do you exhaust your grip, you tire yourself out.",
        "Got it? Ugh, all that effort is taking its toll on me.",
        "Because training is too much like fighting, and I'd really rather not fight.",
        "Also, I find training terribly dull. Anyway. Good night.",
        "My wisdom? About?",
        "You're not asking me for help with the butchery, are you? If so, stop right there. I despise the sight of blood.",
        "Oh, thank goodness. Then whatever do you need from me? I'm not much of a cook.",
        "Why not gather wood in the morning? Get some sleep now.",
        "OK, let me see... Easy-to-forage wood at this time of night...",
        "You know, there were a good number of desks and chairs in the ruined corner of the monastery.",
        "Some of the stuff there is salvageable, so none of it has been thrown away.",
        "There's definitely high-quality oak and beech out there. Both would be excellent for smoking meat.",
        "Well, I wouldn't say that...",
        "As long as it's anything that looks broken beyond repair, no one should complain.",
        "Pardon?",
        "But it's bedtime... OK, fine. I can point out the choice smoking wood.",
        "Ugh... Then I'll have to help haul it all back, won't I?",
        "Please stop with the praising.",
        "All right, fine. I'll help.",
        "'''' I'm just...that nice a guy...",
        "I am the one who suggested it would be great firewood. I suppose it's only fair I get punished too.",
        "My apologies, Petra. My idea turned out to be worthless.",
        "Well, at least you'll have no worries about provisions.",
        "I just realized... They didn't actually tell us when the punishment will be over.",
        "How are you so obedient and yet so passionate at the— Oh! Look, Petra! The book you were searching for.",
        "Heh, well, books are my field of expertise. Still, what a stroke of luck.",
        "What's that?",
        "Hmm, interesting observation. I wonder why that is?",
        "You always ask me so earnestly. You seem to throw your entire being into all that you do.",
        "I guess I rather like it...working as hard as you do. On occasion, that is.",
        "Yes. You inspire me to be, well, something that is not normally me.",
        "I think you may be right. Your strength and my wisdom...",
        "That sounds like a wonderful combination.",
        "Annette? Are you OK with all those boxes?",
        "Smart thinking. \"Do it all at once!\" That's what they say, right? Work smart, not hard.",
        "I think you've got it from here, so I'm off to take a nap. Good luck.",
        "That was almost pretty bad.",
        "I'd call it insomnia, but I suppose it was really just a guilty conscience. I came to see if you needed help. And sure enough, here you are, about to tip all the boxes on the floor.",
        "Huh? But it was your job. Why would I step in? You clearly had things handled.",
        "If the boxes had fallen just now, everyone would have had to help tidy them up anyway. If anything broke, more boxes would need to be carried... And if all of that came to pass, then there'd be noise and more noise and no chance of my taking a nap.",
        "Correct. But there was no danger yet, and so there was no need for my help. So I left you to it. Try carrying one box at a time instead of straining to do it all at once. Work smart, not hard, as they say. All right, well, I think you've got it from here, so I'm off. Good luck.",
        "Mm? Mmm, huh? What, is it morning already?",
        "If that's the case, I suppose I can sleep a little longer...",
        "Calm down... Calm down. I was having a wonderful dream...",
        "I was dreaming about the best afternoon nap of my life, and the dream I was having in the dream was amazing...",
        "I sleep because I'm tired. What other reason would I have?",
        "Well, not all the time, no. Most nights, I'm quite wide awake. Sometimes I get distracted and forget to sleep. Usually, I sleep for two days for every three I'm awake.",
        "I can't help it that my sleep schedule fails to line up with everyone else's.",
        "I'll be fine, Annette. I'll be just...fine... Anyway, I'm pretty beat. Talk again soon.",
        "Sorry, Annette...I was really out.",
        "Middle of a war or no, you'll not defeat the master of dreams. He's a fiercely strong enemy.",
        "No joking, I assure you. He is quite unstoppable. Or perhaps you know his weakness?",
        "You told me something? When?",
        "\"is how you grow.\" Is that the one?",
        "Should I not have remembered?",
        "** '''' Hmm... Have you been speaking to Hubert?",
        "The truth is I place effort in what brings me joy. I'm happiest that way.",
        "Not as such. Why would I go through that effort? For what gain?",
        "Oh, I see. Well then, continue working hard for my sake. For example, waking me up today. And I suppose I will try to do a little bit more for you too... I find working for others to be annoying, yet I wish to make an exception for you. I hope that's all right...",
        "Indeed. You're the only person I'd bother helping. I could wear myself out helping you. Forever, maybe. What about it? I'll be there for you, and you can be there for me.",
        "What?",
        "Huh. You know, I feel as if you might be able to wake me up every morning. No small feat, that.",
        "Aha, Lysithea. It's wrong to tease, yet I can hardly help myself... I know a secret. Your secret, in fact.",
        "Well... It's a secret that could completely overturn what is considered common knowledge in Crest research...",
        "There was a sort of accident in Professor Hanneman's room...",
        "Of course not. If someone else were to learn you have two Crests, I might lose you as a test subject.",
        "My intuition was correct! You do have two Crests.",
        "\"Trick\" is such a strong word. I think of it as testing a hypothesis. The truth is I simply made an educated guess.",
        "I disagree. For example, you could tell me if you were born with them. Or is the source magical? What does it feel like to use both Crests at the same time? Is it pleasant? Painful? Euphoric?",
        "I understand her desire for privacy, but to refuse my request for knowledge? Well...it's rude.",
        "There you are, Lysithea. I've been looking for you. So I have a hypothesis about your Crests...",
        "What? No. Of course not. However, I wonder what you would have done if it was...",
        "I'm sorry, but that is not the overall topic of discussion. Do pay attention.",
        "You don't have a very positive opinion of your Crests, do you? That's why you should listen to me.",
        "I've dug through all my books, and there's no record of anyone being born with two Crests. You are, to be blunt, an impossible occurrence. For you to have a second Crest, it must have been forcibly implanted after birth.",
        "Yes. It is. To further the theory, if the power exists to implant a Crest, then it must be possible to remove one too. And that is the real issue at hand.",
        "**'' That's what Hanneman is working on understanding. I'm helping him with it.",
        "Based on your reaction, it seems you want one of your Crests removed... I don't think I'd give up having two Crests if I were you.",
        "What you see before you, Lysithea, is a life choice.",
        "The most skilled pastry chef in the army has been asked to do the impossible in the heart of wartime... Source high-quality ingredients, employ advanced baking methods, and create...these two pastries.",
        "Of course. You can have but one though, and it should be noted that they taste completely different. I thought I'd split them between us, seeing as they were made so carefully and are so very, very special.",
        "Oh, no. For you see, if you eat one, you simply cannot - must not - eat the other. Should you eat both, a pair of ingredients - one in each pastry - will combine to poison you.",
        "Of course not. But making this choice means you will not be able to taste the second dessert...ever. No matter what I tell you, you'll never know which one tasted best. And if you were underwhelmed by your choice, you'll regret your decision forever.",
        "But you've already chosen, haven't you? Not between the pastries but your life paths. You would gamble on the chance of living a long life, even if it meant losing your two Crests. Correct? Hence my current choice.",
        "A shortened lifespan doesn't necessarily mean a short life. Even with two Crests, you might live a long time. And with you around, the study of Crests will undoubtedly reach previously unimagined levels. On the other hand... Getting rid of them could help someone that I care about. Maybe. Or maybe it won't help at all. Unfortunately, one never knows until they eat the pastry. Even then, you can never taste them both.",
        "When indeed. You are someone I care about though. So much so, I wish we could be family, you and I.",
        "Anyway, I need to be going. Oh, and feel free to eat the pastries. I made up the poison bit because I didn't know how else to say what I wished to say. And because...well, because I believe there are choices we can make where you can have both. I'll show you somehow...before the war is over.",
        "Ah, there it is. Just as I thought. But what is she hiding?",
        "Ah, Marianne. You're no bother at all. In fact, you've arrived at precisely the right time.",
        "You have a Crest, don't you?",
        "If you hide it, that just makes it more interesting. You do have one.",
        "What?",
        "Who said I intended to tell anyone? Your secret is safe with me. I find it fascinating that you carry the Crest of the Erased Hero—",
        "Bad luck generated by the Crest? Now that would be a discovery well worth making. What manner of bad luck do you suppose might beset me?",
        "It's true, I don't understand ... but I very much want to.",
        "Ah, Marianne. Harvesting the crops?",
        "Ah, see, you've mistaken me for someone who sticks his hands in the dirt.",
        "Oh, I see. You're afraid that everyone who eats them will suffer bad luck?",
        "Marianne, that's simply not the way the world works. You see - Uh... forget about it. Tell me which ones to pick.",
        "Happy to help... but I'm beat. You'll have to carry them yourself, so take them straight in, OK?",
        "Oh, actually, before I go, do you mind if I ask you a question? I've been thinking... Isn't it more the case that your Crest brings happiness rather than bad luck?",
        "Yes, happiness. Because your Crest is so rare. It excites my mind, and, well... If not for your Crest, we might have never met, and I feel that would be a tremendous loss. Backbreaking as it was, I enjoyed today. I'm quite happy right now, and it's due entirely to your Crest.",
        "It's a huge breakthrough to know that your Crest causes happiness instead of bad luck. I'd love to study it thoroughly, but only if you'd agree. Really, I just want to find a way for your crest to bring you happiness too.",
        "I understand. May I ask one more thing though? Could you please hand me one of those vegetables?",
        "Thank you, Marianne. I think this looks like a very lucky vegetable.",
        "There you are, Marianne. I'd like a moment to talk.",
        "Hm, all right. Afterwards.",
        "So then, you're done?",
        "I was sleeping. Are you ready to talk now?",
        "I wasn't waiting. As I said, I was sleeping. I didn't want to disrupt your prayers.",
        "The results of my research.",
        "I intended to look into the power of your Crest from the first moment I met you. I've been feeling quite happy as of late, and I can conclude that it is due to your Crest.",
        "Or, more likely, I feel good because I've recently taken a bit of exercise.",
        "Although, keeping you from finding out I was researching you was plenty of exercise on its own. Listen, Marianne. I'll tell you one thing for certain... Your Crest is not the source of anyone's bad luck.",
        "The research on your Crest is lacking, but other Crests have been studied quite a bit. I can find no proof that a Crest can influence the lives of those who come in contact with its bearer. And frankly, transmitting bad luck via touch sounds like a crazy superstition. Don't you agree?",
        "By the way, eating the vegetables you gave me caused me no ill effects. They were delicious as ever. It may have been another story if I drank your blood... Ugh, now I'm nauseous.",
        "All right, all right, sorry. As I said, it is my scholarly opinion that your Crest does not cause bad luck.",
        "It's probably just that you and the people around you have had some bad days. It happens. I'm going to watch over you from now on, and if either of us has bad luck... Well, I'll look into whether it's just chance or if it's your Crest. In fact, I'll dedicate my life to it.",
        "Especially for you, Marianne. Don't make me spell it out...",
        "Hello, Flayn. I'm curious if you could confirm some suspicions I have.",
        "I've recently been lost in study on the topic of Saint Cethleann. You're familiar with her life, yes?",
        "Interesting that you would ask that. Your question betrays your understanding of my inquiry.",
        "I have interviewed several members of the academy and the monastery. All agree that you have trouble focusing on detail-oriented work. As I mentioned, I have been carefully researching Saint Cethleann's history, and I found several intriguing anecdotes concerning her life. Granted, it is not stated explicitly in the texts, but it is easy enough to read between the lines and get to the underlying truth. The authors of several tomes, all written within 50 years of Saint Cethleann's passing, imply she found it difficult to maintain focus on detail-oriented tasks. Then, just this morning, as I was studying statues of Saint Cethleann, I came to realize how similar her visage is to your own. Interesting, no?",
        "No disrespect intended, I assure you. Saint Cethleann is a major saint. I only mean to say that looking like her is an honor.",
        "There was one other item...",
        "You are quite skilled in white magic, yes? My understanding is that you have a very high affinity for the art.",
        "Indeed! Once more, an echo of Saint Cethleann. I'm so curious as to why such similarities exist. Her Crest... Perhaps hereditary traits, then? Or is it possible I am allowing myself to see patterns where there are none? Hmmm...",
        "Flayn! I have another question for you if you please.",
        "A breakthrough has been made concerning your Crest.",
        "Well, yes. I've been trying to keep that quiet. Part of my interest on this topic is that I possess a minor Crest of Cethleann myself.",
        "Possessing a minor Crest is uncommon but not rare among the noble families. However, a major Crest of Cethleann—that is beyond rare.",
        "I am quite curious as to why you were born with such a rare major Crest. Given that mine is a minor Crest of the same type, it's possible that you and I are distant relations.",
        "Oh? Do you have access to a detailed ancestry? That could be a most useful tome.",
        "A shame. Oh, to explore one's lineage and investigate such possibilities. Alas, the odds of your being a direct descendant of Saint Cethleann are quite low. The prevailing theory among respectable scholars is that Saint Cethleann died having never married.",
        "While I do not subscribe to your absolute certainty, I do agree your relation to her is highly unlikely. Yet there is some connection between yourself and Saint Cethleann...",
        "Nothing. My apologies. Simply thinking aloud. I do hope we can continue this discussion sometime.",
        "Reading anything interesting?",
        "Reading these, it's easy to imagine what it would feel like to exist long ago. Fódlan's history spans thousands of years. We're lucky to have so many detailed records of our past.",
        "And why not?",
        "About our shared Crests...",
        "There's an experiment I wish to attempt, although it might prove to be a bit troublesome.",
        "Pain? No. There won't... Well...I'm unsure of the results, but that's why they call it an experiment. It would, of course, require that you and I get married.",
        "Yes. If bearers of major and minor Cethleann Crests reproduce... What Crest would the offspring possess, if any? I must know and thought the question might pique your interest as well.",
        "Yes. Such parentage has never been documented. A whole new field of research awaits. It would be a worthy experiment, and we'd need only five or so children for a good sample size.",
        "Pardon? Which part?",
        "I like you well enough to advance a field of study to previously unknown heights. How do you feel?",
        "Do you imagine I've spent all this time talking to you because I was bored? Anyway, I'm pretty worn out now, so let's continue this conversation another time, yes?",
        "Talking to anybody tires me out. Thinking, putting thoughts into words, opening my mouth-all tiring. Do give some thought to my proposal. Think of how far we could advance Crest research, you and I.",
        "Hello, Professor Hanneman. Actually, this book's about fishing.",
        "I'm sorry to betray your expectations. Truth be told, I've been thinking of giving up on my Crest research.",
        "No, it's nothing to do with fishing. I adore the subject of Crests. But to study them, you have to consult the people who bear them, right? I just don't have the energy for that.",
        "I'm sure the satisfaction of catching a fish is pretty great too.",
        "Calm down. I get it. Really.",
        "I... had never thought about it like that. Perhaps if I did have a goal, I might share your enthusiasm on the subject.",
        "Professor Hanneman, do you have a moment?",
        "Last time we talked, you mentioned the importance of having goals. I gave it some thought, and in the end, I couldn't find one.",
        "What's your goal, if you don't mind me asking?",
        "Huh. That's a pretty big dream... But then wouldn't you end up studying everyone? In that world, you'd be killing yourself trying to do research on every person alive.",
        "Hmm, maybe so.",
        "To be brutally honest... It would be way less exhausting but less satisfying as well. That's like fishing at a market.",
        "That sounds like enthusiasm. That's not something I have. But if we worked together... I wonder if it would spark that enthusiasm.",
        "In the end, I think it would probably be more interesting than fishing alone. I don't even have anyone to show any big fish I catch.",
        "Hapi? Yikes, you look like you just crawled out of a lake. Here, dry yourself off. And don't just stand there, you'll catch a cold. Come on, I'll make you some tea.",
        "Huh. It's been ages since I had a nice cup of tea during a rainstorm. Pretty nice, eh?",
        "Doesn't rain make you want to read a book? Or rather, nap with a book on your lap. Though... I guess I'd like that no matter the weather. But then, if the book is too good, not only will I be unable to sleep, my tea would get cold... That makes brewing it a wasted effort. Ah... And that's why I don't drink tea while it rains.",
        "Huh? About what?",
        "Oh, good point. Thing is, I'm not cut out for battle. If a fight breaks out, I'm only a liability. It's better for everyone if I keep my distance.",
        "What do you mean? Use your words to make the things in your head make sense to the rest of us.",
        "They're probably afraid you'll sigh, since you looked pretty rough when we came in. Makes sense. Your sighs are disastrous. If I can prevent one with a nice, lazy cup of tea, it's the least I can do.",
        "Surprised or not, it's no skin off my back. I'll keep doing what I do regardless of anyone's expectations. Think on that. I expected you to be a hazard, but you weren't. No harm, no foul. No need to sigh.",
        "Ugh, this path isn't the right way either. Why do epic quests always involve a lot of legwork?",
        "What sort of thing? You? I'd say you're way more important than the pursuit of war. More interesting too.",
        "I'm sorry my sincerity rubbed you the wrong way. I meant what I said, but that's fine. Now back to your ability... I've discovered that this power can be attributed to your blood. The magic originates from your Crest. There have been leaps and bounds in research on summoning magic focused on an arbitrary target. The only remaining problems are perception and distance. Though it could be argued—",
        "You don't have to understand it to appreciate its implications. Here's the connection—once we understand your power, it's essential that we have a theoretical grasp on how to control it.",
        "That...isn't as scientific as what I had in mind.",
        "Huh? Why me?! Ugh... I guess it can't be helped. I suppose foisting this task on Professor Hanneman would be a waste of my precious efforts... This isn't what I had in mind, but I guess I'm the only man for the job, come to think of it.",
        "It's more walking than I expected. I've lost sleep over this. But you're way more important than a... Oh, right. You don't like me when I'm sincere. Welp, let's get on with the adventure, then. We'll check out that hidden passage next. We've got to find that book that Timotheos is said to have left behind. Come along.",
        "I've come this far. Now I've got to see it through to the end. How will I ever nap in peace otherwise?"

        "Honestly, what do they all take me for? I'm fine. Perfectly and completely fine. It's hardly different from daytime. I'm not scared.",
        "Ahhhhh! Guh-guh-GHOST! Uh... Hang on... Professor? Is that you? Oh, well... Good evening! Hahaha!",
        "Oh, I left something in the dining hall, so I'm on my way to fetch it. But you don't need to come with me or anything like that. I'm fine on my own—really!",
        "You weren't? Oh. Apologies for making an assumption. The truth is, everyone I come across asks if I'd like some company. They all seem to think I'll be scared wandering alone at night. So rude and presumptuous, you know? I'm perfectly capable of being on my own!",
        "Hey! Professor, wait! I...um, well... I thought it might be nice to walk and talk together to the dining hall. Shall we? To be abundantly clear, this has nothing to do with my nonexistent fear of ghosts.",
        "Do you mind, um, filling the void with some chatter? Some find silence to be a bit unsettling, after all.",
        "OK, I confess. I AM scared of ghosts! The monastery is unnerving to me at night. So can we talk about something, please? Anything! I've noticed for quite some time now—you treat all your students equally, don't you? You've never treated me differently simply because I'm younger than the others. And I've always appreciated that.",
        "Isn't it rather obvious? I'm roughly two to three years younger than the rest of the class. Have you not been paying close enough attention to those you teach? That's poor form for a professor... Oh! There, I've found what I was looking for! Well, I'd better be on my way now. Good night!",
        "Professor, thank you for helping me with my training.",
        "I'd love to do this again, if possible. Your advice is always so useful. Everyone thinks you're a wonderful teacher. You account for people's weaknesses while capitalizing on their strengths. Initially I wasn't sure you paid too much attention to your students. Clearly, I was wrong. After all, were that the case, you wouldn't be capable of providing such useful feedback. I'll continue to learn and grow from your instruction, Professor. I just know it!",
        "You think I'm determined?",
        "Professor, I... Thank you! You're the only one who's ever praised me like that. I mean, people are always telling me I've got a knack for magic. If you can call the power of Crests a \"knack\", they aren't wrong, per se. Though bearing two Crests isn't a gift I ever asked for... Anyhow, I've made a point to work harder than most and not rely too heavily on the power they bestow. So I find it frustrating that the only praise I seem to receive is directly related to that power. If you've noticed how hard I work, then, well... It just... It makes me very happy.",
        "Well, you see... I... It is because I am the only child of House Ordelia. I must do all I can for my family name. I'm determined to someday be of real value to them, and that day must come soon. I can't waste any time. I don't have much of it left... Anyway, I should be going. Thank you again for your help!",
        "Thank you for helping me with my training again today, Professor. I'm gonna keep at it for a while longer, so you go on ahead.",
        "I can't. Not when I'm right on the cusp of using my power to greater potential. Surely you yourself are tired. Just...don't worry about me, OK?",
        "I'm sorry, Professor. It was careless of me to continue, despite how fatigued I clearly was. I probably should have listened to you. Now I've made a mess of things. I can't help but feel the need to rush, in all things, constantly. You get that way when you realize...you haven't got much time.",
        "** '''': I believe I've mentioned that House Ordelia was, at one time, being controlled by people from the Empire. During that time, strange people — mages, perhaps — came and performed rituals on all the youth within my family.",
        "With the Empire monitoring our every move, my parents could do nothing but watch in horror as all of this unfolded. One after another, the children died, until the only one left...was me. You know, my hair wasn't always this color. During their experiments, they'd been doing things with my blood. One morning, I awoke like this — a shock of white hair, all trace of pigment, gone. Upon seeing me, the mages were delighted. They realized that their experiments had finally succeeded. Sure enough, they ran a test and saw that two Crests coexisted within me. Losing pigment from my hair wasn't the only loss. The mages informed me that my lifespan was now greatly shortened. Five more years at most. Perhaps less.",
        "Shortly thereafter, the mages lost interest in me, and we never saw them in the Ordelia household again. Since all that, our family has been in decline — it's challenging now even to govern our territory. After all my mother and father have suffered, I at least want them to have peace as they grow older. That is all I wish for...but I haven't much time to ensure it comes to pass.",
        "It's not like what's been done to me can be undone.",
        "Professor... The only way I can conceive of would be to remove my Crests somehow. But I don't know if that's even remotely possible. Even if it were... I wouldn't be of much use to you and the others without my Crests.",
        "You sound resolved. I'll allow your resolve to bolster my own! Thank you, Professor.",
        "Professor, I...",
        "We have. I can feel that the Crests are no longer a part of me.",
        "That must mean I'll... I mean, my body will...",
        "Thank you, Professor. No matter the outcome, I feel a sense of peace.",
        "I have hope, and that hope will carry me through it all.",
        "You've done so much, searching for a way to remove my Crests—to save me.",
        "I can't tell you how much it means to me.",
        "I will not claim my title. House Ordelia will end with my father's generation.",
        "After this, I'm going to begin preparations for our family's dissolution.",
        "This will ensure that the people of our territory will not be troubled. And my parents will be able to live out their lives in peace.",
        "A good question...",
        "I hadn't considered it. But, assuming I have life left in me...",
        "Would it be all right if I came back here? To...stay by your side?",
        "Without my Crests, I'm not sure what all I'd be able to do for you.",
        "But you have given me a new life. I want to use my time to support you however I can.",
        "I just...",
        "Oh! Is this... This is...",
        "What I said earlier about not caring what the outcome of all this is... I take it back.",
        "For the longest time, I didn't think I'd be around to be a part of the future you and everyone were creating. That I had no place in it.",
        "But now, I cannot fight it any longer... I do care. And I do not wish to give up on chasing that future.",
        "I do not wish to die! I refuse to give up...on myself, or on our future.",
        "And so...I promise to come back to you. No matter what!",
        "'''Once I'm back...'''",
        "'''Yes, I quite like the sound of that. Together! It is decided. We will be together forever. Living long, full lives! Count on it, my love.'''",
        "Honestly, what so they all take me for? I'm fine. Perfectly and completely fine. It's hardly different from daytime. I'm not scared.",
        "Ahhhhh! Guh-guh-GHOST! Uh... Hang on... Professor? Is that you? Oh, well... Good evening! Hahaha!",
        "Oh, I left something in the dining hall, so I'm on my way to fetch it. But you don't need to come with me or anything like that. I'm fine on my own—really!",
        "You weren't? Oh. Apologies for making an assumption. The truth is, everyone I come across asks if I'd like some company. They all seem to think I'll be scared wandering alone at night. So rude and presumptuous, you know? I'm perfectly capable of being on my own!",
        "Hey! Professor, wait! I... um, well... I thought it would be nice to walk and talk together, to the dining hall. Shall we? To be abundantly clear, this has nothing to do with my nonexistent fear of ghosts.",
        "Do you mind, um, filling the void with some chatter? Some find silence to be a bit unsettling, after all.",
        "OK, I confess. I AM scared of ghosts! The monastery is unnerving to me at night. So can we talk about something, please? Anything! I've noticed for quite some time now—you treat all your students equally, don't you? You've never treated me differently simply because I'm younger than the others. And I've always appreciated that.",
        "Isn't it rather obvious? I'm roughly two to three years younger than the rest of the class. Have you not been paying enough attention to those you teach? That's poor form for a professor... Oh! There, I've found what I was looking for! Well, I'd better be on my way now. Good night!",
        "Professor, thank you for helping me with my training.",
        "I'd like to do this again, if possible. Your advice is always so useful. Everyone thinks you're a wonderful teacher. You account for people's weaknesses while capitalizing on their strengths. Initially I wasn't sure you paid too much attention to your students. Clearly, I was wrong. After all, were that the case, you wouldn't be capable of providing such useful feedback. I'll continue to learn and grow from your instruction, Professor. I just know it!",
        "You think I'm determined?",
        "Professor, I... Thank you! You're the only one who's ever praised me like that. I mean, people are always telling me I've got a knack for magic. If you can call the power of my Crests a \"knack,\" they aren't wrong, per se. Though, having two crests isn't a gift I ever asked for... Anyhow, I've made a point to work harder than most and not rely too heavily on the power they bestow. So I find it frustrating that the only praise I receive is directly related to that power. If you've noticed how hard I work, then, well... It just... It makes me happy.",
        "Well, you see... I... It is because I am the only child of house Ordelia. I must do all I can for the family name. I'm determined to someday be of real value to them, and that day must come soon. I can't waste any time. I don't have much of it left... Anyway, I should be going. Thanks again for your help!",
        "Thank you for helping me with my training again today, Professor. I'm gonna keep at it for a while longer, so you go on ahead.",
        "I can't. Not when I'm right on the cusp of using my power to greater potential. Surely you yourself are tired. Just...don't worry about me, OK?",
        "I'm sorry, Professor. It was careless of me to continue, despite how fatigued I clearly was. I probably should have listened to you. Now I've made a mess of things. I can't help but feel the need to rush, in all things, constantly. You get that way when you realize...you haven't got much time.",
        "** '''': I believe I've mentioned that House Ordelia was, at one time, being controlled by people from the Empire. During that time, strange people — mages, perhaps — came and performed rituals on all the youth within my family.",
        "With the Empire monitoring our every move, my parents could do nothing but watch in horror as all of this unfolded. One after another, the children died, until the only one left...was me. You know, my hair wasn't always this color. During their experiments, they'd been doing things with my blood. One morning, I awoke like this — a shock of white hair, all trace of pigment, gone. Upon seeing me, the mages were delighted. They realized that their experiments had finally succeeded. Sure enough, they ran a test and saw that two Crests coexisted within me. Losing pigment from my hair wasn't the only loss. The mages informed me that my lifespan was now greatly shortened. Five more years at most. Perhaps less.",
        "Shortly thereafter, the mages lost interest in me, and we never saw them in the Ordelia household again. Since all that, our family has been in decline — it's challenging now even to govern our territory. After all my mother and father have suffered, I at least want them to have peace as they grow older. That is all I wish for...but I haven't much time to ensure it comes to pass.",
        "It's not like what's been done to me can be undone.",
        "Professor... The only way I can conceive of would be to remove my Crests somehow. But I don't know if that's even remotely possible. Even if it were... I wouldn't be of much use to you and the others without my Crests.",
        "You sound resolved. I'll allow your resolve to bolster my own! Thank you, Professor.",
        "Huh? Oh! No, no-I'm fine! Really. Just not accustomed to so much manual labor.",
        "Yes. The other student who was assigned to tidy up with me wasn't feeling well, so it's just me. I figured I could at least dust the bookshelves or something, but I...uh...I got a little carried away.",
        "As much as I love books, I can't say I love carrying stacks of them to and fro. They're so heavy.",
        "I can do without the condescension, thanks. After all, I'm the only one who has to deal with the fact that I've worn myself out.",
        "Considering what?",
        "But I want to finish what I've started!",
        "Ugh. Fine. As long as you'll finish all this up.",
        "Yes, yes. Thank you.",
        "Edelgard, do you have a minute?",
        "Yes, please! I never say no to sweets.",
        "Isn't that the whole point of cake? Well, more for me. Mmm, these are fantastic with this tea.",
        "Mmm, mm. So, I, ah, can tell you know a fair bit about me. Mmm...",
        "Gulp. Edelgard. You know a fair bit about me. Don't you?",
        "For example, the fact that I have two Crests.",
        "No need to play coy with me. It won't work. It's clear my body has succumbed to the intense pressure of bearing two Crests. Due to the immense requirements of bearing these Crests, my life expectancy is...painfully short. You know all of this, right?",
        "Still won't drop the act, huh? Despite how obvious you've been with your concern about my health?",
        "I'm not really in the mood for these games. Given your rank, you certainly have access to all kinds of information that others do not. Clearly, you'd have heard all about me.",
        "Correct. It wasn't as though I had a say in any of this.",
        "You speak of all of this as though you understand it on a personal level... Edelgard, have you...",
        "I understand.",
        "There's no need to pander to me! But...yes. I'll take those. Thanks.",
        "Fine, thank you. And yourself?",
        "I overheard something recently. Something pertaining to you and your vision for the future... Is it really true that you intend to create a world in which Crests no longer exist?",
        "I really agree with your thinking. My parents have suffered throughout their lives due to their nobility. Due to my own Crests, I've never been able to live a normal life. I'm sick of nobility and Crests—of all of it. It sounds as if it's truly your mission to change things. I'll pledge my life to your cause, however short it may be.",
        "Has your hair always been that color, by the way?",
        "I ask because mine wasn't always this color. I lost all pigment after receiving my two Crests. Edelgard, I want a world where people like you and I are no longer victimized. I want you to bring that world into being. If it's within me to help that come to pass, then I'll do whatever it takes.",
        "Whatever terrible fate awaits us, we can fight it and prevail!",
        "I...I promise. I will try my best to believe that.",
        "Ugh, please do not call me that! But uh...yes. Yes, I would.",
        "Ah, so I see... If one were to combine this incantation method with the power of a Crest, then in theory, it should─",
        "Claude, I really don't appreciate you interrupting me right now.",
        "Uh-huh. The last thing I need is you fretting over me as though I'm some child. I'm only a few years younger than you, you know. Hardly worth nothing. Furthermore, my grades in magic─and basically every other subject─are far higher than yours.",
        "Ugh, the audacity! Whatever it is you think you're treating me like, it's unendingly annoying.",
        "I find myself speechless in the wake of your staggering ignorance. Now, please, leave me be.",
        "You know... I am suddenly rather sleepy! Excuse me while I see myself out!",
        "Hang on... If we're trying to repel the enemy, I should be positioned there, correct?",
        "Claude! Will you knock it off already? So help me, if you continue treating me like a child, I'll─",
        "Hmph! I've more pride than to turn an unarmed soldier to cinders. It wouldn't kill you to speak to me as an equal when we're discussing matters as serious as this!",
        "Hmm...",
        "Perhaps that's true...",
        "Truly?",
        "Fair enough, then. From here forward, see to it that you treat me with the respect of an equal. And.. I admit that you are not short on talent yourself, but don't go getting a big head over it.",
        "Strategically speaking, if I poised an archer to lie in wait here, and then lured the enemy in over here...",
        "I am, but I don't see how it's any of your business.",
        "I apologize for my sharpness. I just feel pressured.",
        "I place a lot of personal pressure on myself─I need to become as strong as possible, to put my parents at ease.",
        "That's true.",
        "You really are very mature, Claude. Despite the impression you give off. And I clearly have plenty of growing to do. I probably don't have much room to come down on you for harping on me.",
        "That is absolutely not what I said! Just after you'd finally earned a small degree of respect from me too.",
        "You think I'm special?",
        "How dare you!",
        "I'm feeling generous, so I'll let you off easy this one time.",
        "All right, buddy, you asked for it!",
        "Ahem...",
        "Hm?",
        "I've got better things to do. Although I do wonder why everyone is always so eager to help you.",
        "So I've noticed. That's what strikes me as odd.",
        "I see... That would explain it.",
        "There's no reason to deny what's clearly true. Everything about your outward appearance is immaculate and well thought out. Even your fingernails are always well-kept and painted—no doubt your toenails are the same.",
        "And you smell delightful. Like...candy. Or wait — Am I catching a hint of floral?",
        "Floral oils, huh? I didn't think they had much use outside of homeopathy and house cleaning...",
        "Mmm. It's lovely. Now I smell just like you, Hilda.",
        "Somehow this makes me feel a little more...mature. Thank you.",
        "Uhh, Hilda? What's that box you're holding... It's...making me nervous for some reason.",
        "I, uh, don't recall ever asking you to—",
        "Uh... I've never used makeup before. It sounds...complicated.",
        "Why would I want to appear vulnerable? I don't want to be attacked!",
        "Ugh. You're treating me like a child... But I guess it's mostly harmless.",
        "Gracefully... extending... Argh. Suddenly standing and sitting are an exhausting activity!",
        "Hilda, that's enough. This is wearing me out.",
        "I'm not sure I'm cut out for this type of thing.",
        "No, thanks. You're more suited to such things. I'll leave it to you. I haven't the time or the energy to fuss over how I'm perceived. Even with my best efforts, I'll never be as good at this as you are. Still, this was rather fun. Thank you, Hilda.",
        "I think you mean a baseless rumor. Why are you wasting your time? And mine, for that matter.",
        "Shut your mouth! Just...ugh. Let's go talk somewhere other than here.",
        "OK. Where did you hear about it?",
        "I should've figured. You haven't told anyone, have you?",
        "Ah! Please stop talking so loudly! So what if I have two Crests? If you insist on speaking of it, please do so quietly.",
        "Wait— What?! Did you just trick me?",
        "Ugh. Well, now that I've confirmed it for you, there's not much I can do.",
        "Enough is enough! I am done talking about this! As though I'd speak of this to the likes of you.",
        "I know you're the one who sent me that \"anonymous\" letter. \"There are things we must discuss...\" Ugh, it sounded like some bizarre love letter.",
        "Now I'm just confused...and grossed out.",
        "Pay attention to you? As though anything you say is worth listening to. It's not like you can tell me anything I don't already know.",
        "Um...",
        "Is that your theory, then?",
        "I... I could have one removed?",
        "Professor Hanneman...",
        "Is that so? Even if you'd gone through horrifying experiments, endless trauma, and if you knew that all this pain meant you'd die very, very young... That's what you'd think? You're completely lacking in empathy, so of course you would make such a crass and foolish assumption.",
        "Uh...you seem to have lined up your desserts very meticulously.",
        "Oh really?",
        "Wow, you've put a lot of thought into this. May I?",
        "Ah. Thanks. So, what exactly is the life choice you mentioned? Also, if you are not partaking, I'll just go ahead and eat them both.",
        "That seems unnecessarily intense. Just one won't kill me, then?",
        "So...I should just pick one and be done with it.",
        "Wait—whose choice are we talking about now?",
        "Hang on, Linhardt. Do you mean to tell me you care about me? Since when?",
        "Family?! That escalated rather quickly. Although...having more family does sound nice.",
        "Are you sure these aren't poisoned? Linhardt, wait! Wait!",
        "Mmmmm...yum. Mmmm... Ahh, so delicious! I'm so content in this moment.",
        "Felix!",
        "How long have you been there? Were you watching me? You were, weren't you?",
        "Ugh, for once I thought I had some privacy.",
        "Huh? Nope. Didn't say anything at all. Here.",
        "I'm buying your silence... with cake. Take it.",
        "If people knew I was shoveling cake into my face by the fistful, they'd think me nothing more than a child!",
        "You'll never understand. Just take this, will you!?",
        "Does your refusal mean you'll be telling everyone about my cake-shoveling ways?",
        "Nonsense! Nobody can resist something so delicious. Look, I'm giving you this cake whether you like it or not. Eat it, toss it, throw it at an unsuspecting victim—the choice is yours. Just please don't mention this to anyone.",
        "Mmmm! Ahh yes! These are the moments I live for!",
        "You again?! Can't you see I'm busy?",
        "So, how did you like the cake? I bet you ate it, didn't you? I knew it was irresistible. What was the experience like? I'm curious, from a research perspective.",
        "You...gave it to some...undeserving child?!",
        "Cake is not a \"sweet.\" Cake is the divine essence of the heavens!",
        "That's true, but life without cake is no life at all. Your divisiveness regarding cake is inexcusable.",
        "I simply can't resist the spongy magnificence of cakes. I don't understand how you can be so dispassionate about it.",
        "Just try a bite. Come on. Open up!",
        "But I made this one. With care and attention—love even. Ah, And I went light on the sugar, just for you!",
        "More or less. Just don't give it to some silly child this time.",
        "Felix! I've awaited this fated day!",
        "Aw, come on. I just wanted to hear what you thought of the cake I gave you.",
        "If by edible you mean incredible, then yes! I agree.",
        "Please refrain from lumping delectable cake into the same category as provisions.",
        "You have an interesting way of giving compliments, but I'm glad you liked it.",
        "You say that as thought I just carry cake on me at all times! Did you want some?",
        "If cake is what you want, you can just ask me directly. It just so happens I have a brand-new recipe I tried out, special for you. It's delicious and not overly sweet. Perfect for you.",
        "Go on—take a bite!",
        "You love it! I can tell. Here, try this one out too!",
        "See! So amazing, huh? Just keep working on that sweet tooth of yours. Then we can share cake notes and eat cake together all the time. That is... It just sounds nice is all.",
        "Uhh, OK.",
        "Doesn't look like much has changed for you since then. And unlike you, I don't have time to waste, so leave me be.",
        "I am absolutely disinterested in spending any time with you. What is it you want, anyway? Clearly you haven't been listening to a word I've been saying. Perhaps it's because I'm younger, you see fit to ignore me when I speak. Is that it?",
        "Ah, so it isn't my age that's to blame for you breezing over my wishes. It's my gender.",
        "Your lack of self-awareness is deeply troubling.",
        "Look. I'm really busy. Super, extremely, inordinately busy. I've got one last thing to say to you.",
        "I'm skilled with magic, and my abilities are finely honed. It's not like I need someone for target practice.",
        "Sylvain, I've been looking for you. Do you have a moment?",
        "Actually, yes. That sounds fine.",
        "I don't really care about the atmosphere. I just wanted to apologize.",
        "Ugh, can you just shut your mouth and listen for once? Here's something you may have already picked up on... I very much dislike being treated like a child. I worked very hard to be where I am now, and such treatment makes it feel like all of that work is being ignored.",
        "Yes, you already told me all of this. Back then you were just as devoted to goofing off as you are now.",
        "And there it is. You're always so quick to flatter every woman you come across. I knew that, and yet I never thought you would direct your antics at me.",
        "I do not mind that you wished to chat with me. In fact... you might even say I was about it. Just a bit.",
        "Well, it's true. Your behavior is maddening, but in retrospect, I realize that was you treating me as you do all women, rather than like a child. I wasn't thinking about it like that at the time, and so, I snapped at you. I could have perhaps approached the matter with a tad more maturity. Therefore, I would like to apologize.",
        "There you go again with your false flattery...",
        "Say what you will ─ you're still going to have to earn my trust. Just this once, I'll cut you some slack. Don't get used to it. It's not like I can change who you are as a person.",
        "I'll leave you with this ─ don't say things you don't mean. It makes it impossible to tell the lies from the truth. Don't come crying to me if you carry on as you have and end up with no friends.",
        "Ugh, you are exhausting. I guess the positivity is OK, though.",
        "Why do I have to?",
        "Is that so. I thought you were something of an honors student at the school of sorcery?",
        "What is that supposed to mean? Are you implying that I don't work hard too? If you think my skills are inherent, you are sorely mistaken.",
        "Hm. And what is it you want to learn about?",
        "Look at how quickly you're picking this up. You're clearly very skilled already.",
        "Do you insist on taking the conversation in that direction?",
        "It's fine. Let's just drop it. A bit more self-confidence would go a long way for you, Annette.",
        "That's all I've got for you today. I need to get going now. Lots to do.",
        "Oh, you're still here?",
        "I did. What are you reading?",
        "Is that The Compendium of Light and Dark?",
        "I've read it so many times I have nearly the entire thing memorized. That said, it does seem to take some liberties with some topics, so be aware of that while you're reading it.",
        "You've got quite the stack of books here for only wanting to brush up on one thing. I knew you were a hard worker, Annette.",
        "It's all right. In getting to know you, I've taken some time to self-reflect. I used to think that I worked harder than anyone. But I'm not so sure anymore. I have to work even harder to keep pace with you!",
        "Well, if you work extra, extra hard, I'll need to work super duper extra hard!",
        "OK, OK. That's enough. We could do this forever, but we've got better things to do.",
        "I'm glad we had this chat. I feel excited to continue working super duper extra hard now. I'm lucky to have someone like you around to inspire me.",
        "Why are you smiling?",
        "It is nice, isn't it? But I still intend to surpass you.",
        "I'm not quite sure how someone of your caliber is struggling with this one, but let me break it down for you...",
        "I know you're always seeking the attention of ladies, but why are you wasting your breath on me.",
        "I'm not sure if I'm the one being silly. Actually— I'm busy. Stuff to do.",
        "I was under the impression you were interested in me as a person. What do house matters have to do with anything?",
        "I couldn't care less.",
        "Yes, yes, of course. When the time comes. But right now, I'm quite busy. Maybe later. As it is, I'm studying magic for the benefit of Fódlan's future, and I would appreciate it if you left me to it.",
        "The future, he says. Hmph. As though I have a future...",
        "Hm... It didn't work. Odd. My logic was sound, or so I thought...",
        "Nope. Busy.",
        "I am perfectly capable of knowing when to stop! I'm no child, I'll have you know.",
        "Ooh, that actually looks pretty tasty... All right. All right, fine.",
        "Oh jeez. Wow. Actually... this is delicious. You have excellent taste, Lorenz.",
        "Ugh, come on. Can't we just enjoy the snacks? I loathe talking about myself.",
        "Can you stop with the kid treatment? I mean, really— is age the only thing you consider when engaging with others?",
        "Are you even listening?! Ugh, it's like you can't even help yourself but to continue treating me like a child!",
        "You really are relentless! I'll spell this out for you once more— I. Don't. Care!",
        "I, sir, am nothing like you— you're bullheaded and boorish. And utterly fixated on the future. All you care about is what's to come. Sure, it's all well and good to be thinking about such lofty things. However... For me, the future's a very long ways off. Better to focus on the present— on the here and now. Thanks for the tea.",
        "Picking wildflowers? Seems such a common activity for someone like you.",
        "Knock it off! Uh, sorry... It's just that the thorns are a bit sharp, and I'm not a fan of killing nature.",
        "Politics. Again.",
        "That's not something you should get your hopes up about. House Ordelia will end with my father.",
        "No, it's just... My body, unfortunately, is not built to last... And I have no siblings. When I die, that's the end.",
        "Noble birth has been nothing but a source of pain for me. For me, and for my parents. We got sucked into the rebellion in the Empire, and it led to...many responsibilities for us. The things we went through... I can hardly bear to speak of it. All I want to do is give my mother and father the chance to live out their years in peace. I intend to do whatever I can to ease the hardships of our people, while I still have life left in me... Naturally, I worry about what will come to pass after I'm gone. But I'm sure things will work out, so long as there are people like you around working so hard for a better future.",
        "Don't worry about it. If you're so insistent upon being my friend, I'm sure more tasty snacks and tea will help persuade me. But if speaking of the future holds such importance, better to find someone who actually has one.",
        "Hmph.",
        "Enough is enough! I am fully aware! Now, stop following me.",
        "That's great and all, but I feel fine today. And I'm perfectly capable of caring for myself. I don't have time to \"take a rest\". I'm overloaded with work, and I have less time than everyone else. I just want to do my own thing, bring order to the Alliance, and put my parents' minds at ease.",
        "That's all well and good, but those vitamin-packed \"sweets\" you brought tasted weird.",
        "You have a point, but those health sweets are gross.",
        "That was pretty nice of you. I'm sorry, Lorenz. Thank you for being so thoughtful. Still, I don't need bushels and bushels of them. Gaining a ton of weight won't exactly lengthen my lifespan either. I mean, I'd like to be able to hang out with you as much as possible and...for as long as possible.",
        "Yikes, keep it down, will you?",
        "OK, OK, noted! Will you just calm down already?",
        "I won't give up on myself either. Thanks for caring, Lorenz.",
        "Ugh, this theory just isn't coming together. The thought behind it is sound enough, but... Hm.",
        "Raphael, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not so sure you'll be much help here.",
        "I have absolutely zero interest in such things.",
        "Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Can't you see I'm busy?! Go bother someone else! What nerve you have, too, calling yourself \"Big Bro!\" Like I'm your little sister or some nonsense. Just cut the act.",
        "Anyway, my grades are miles better than yours. If you want to play the part of \"big brother,\" you'd probably benefit from studying way, way more.",
        "I can't stand all the excuses. Clearly you're the little kid here. You got all that? Now, don't bother me again. Understood? Bye.",
        "So heavy... Ugh. I think I might've borrowed one too many books this time. And I have to return them at some point— ahhh!",
        "Argh, just my luck...",
        "Thank you for the assistance. I can take it from here.",
        "They're all books I need for my studies, and it's my own responsibility. No need to involve others.",
        "No, really. I have this. I am not incapable— and I'm not a child.",
        "You... are remarkably talented at channeling me...",
        "Ugh.",
        "Yeah, yeah. You seem obstinately determined to go against my wishes.",
        "Hey, what're you doing?! They need to be stacked neatly, otherwise they'll topple! This one needs to be rearranged, otherwise the rest won't fit properly!",
        "You're the one who was so insistent on helping. If you're gonna help, do it right or don't bother.",
        "Where is that darn ladder?",
        "I can't find the ladder anywhere, and I need it to check out the books up on that top shelf.",
        "No. I need to be able to dig around myself.",
        "Hang on a sec— That's not! Agh!",
        "I hope nobody saw that. Anyway, thank you. That was helpful. I can't believe how many fantastic books were hidden just out of reach up there. Thanks for being so patient while I rummaged.",
        "Hey, Raphael. You're always extra nice to me. Is it because I remind you of your sister, Maya?",
        "That's certainly something I can relate to.",
        "Young or old, we call all help one another out. We each have our own strengths and weaknesses. Receiving help and providing help in return. It sounds so simple, really...",
        "I do. And I hope you understand that you can come to me for help, too, Raphael. I can't be the only one receiving aid. It makes me feel incompetent and like a kid. I hate that.",
        "I bet it's a disaster, knowing you. I'll help you on that front, but I've got some rules on how to keep things tidy. You'll need to listen up!",
        "Uh...",
        "Whenever I need it, huh? How long does that offer hold?",
        "For always sound nice. I'm fine with that.",
        "Ignatz—hold still, will you?",
        "Your shoes are untied. It looks sloppy. Let me just fix it for you.",
        "Pfft, clearly that's not the case, otherwise this wouldn't be an issue. Now, hush.",
        "There we go.",
        "You've also got awful bedhead.",
        "It's the back of your head. Quite unkempt. You really should get it together. I mean, really. You're born to a noble-adjacent merchant family, aren't you? You really should be more presentable.",
        "Well, consider that if I make even the slightest misstep, everyone will treat me like a child. There's nothing I hate more than that...",
        "Ignatz, are you really lecturing me about how I conduct myself right now? You're a sheepish, unreliable scatterbrain who can only ever think about what others think of him! Perhaps you should worry about your own maturity before you start questioning mine. Although you certainly look the part of a baby, so maybe that's asking too much. Anyway, I've got things to do, so I'm going to go now.",
        "Outta my way. You're such a child, I swear...",
        "Oh, hey. It's you. Going for a walk again today?",
        "All on your own? Hm, I'd better go with you. I'd be worried if you went by yourself.",
        "But won't you have a hard time carrying everything back?",
        "You're right—you don't look it. Your biceps are a fraction of the size of Raphael's. If you start fumbling around under the weight of all the groceries, and then you trip and spill everything everywhere... Look, I'm just saying, that could be your future. It could happen. It doesn't look pretty.",
        "Yep. You're honestly a bit of a mess.",
        "Oh, knock it off with the wounded puppy-dog eyes! As though I'm some sort of villain in your story...",
        "I see. So now it's my fault? No matter how grown you seem to think you are, there's so much you're incapable of. You can play at being a mature adult, but it only ever complicates things. And that's exactly what makes you look like a child.",
        "Maybe I...went a bit far that time... But he's so stubborn despite his ineptitude. I can't just leave it be. He's so foolish—constantly making a mess of things. Wait... But then... No matter how much we stretch, some things are always beyond us. I think it's fine to be vulnerable and ask for help sometimes. What he said to me before... To everyone else, do I seem just like Ignatz?",
        "Um, hey...",
        "Can you help me out with my shopping?",
        "Actually, can you pick up some tea for me? I'd do it, but I'm drowning in work.",
        "I'm not too picky. I just like having it around, really. Whatever's cheapest works for me. Here's some money.",
        "I just thought I could lean on you a bit. You know, rather than trying to do everything on my own.",
        "Oh?",
        "You looked like you were just fine when you went to get groceries the other day.",
        "Aha. So you've stopped trying to do things on your own, then?",
        "Sounds nice, sure. Do you mind brewing mine while you're at it?",
        "Heh.",
        "I mean, you seem plenty reliable to me.",
        "You're fun, you're easy to be around, and you rarely complain when you help others.",
        "It's not easy for me to rely on people, but with you, it's different.",
        "You really are unreliable, as it turns out! Guess I'll just have to take your word for it.",
        "Oh! Marianne! There you are!",
        "There's been an accident at the training grounds—a spell gone amok! Come on—we need all the help we can get over there!",
        "We could really use your help before things get out of hand! Come on! Hurry!",
        "Oh, for the goddess's sake! You won't know unless you try, will you?! Don't decide you're of no use without even giving it a shot! Fine then—forget it. I'll go on my own! You can just stand here and stare at the wall.",
        "Ugh.",
        "Oh... Perhaps I took it too far...",
        "Hey, um...Marianne? Do you have a minute?",
        "Listen, I'm sorry about all the stuff I said earlier. The situation was urgent, and I'll admit I wasn't thinking clearly. I shouldn't have been so callous. I hurt your feelings, didn't I?",
        "Huh? But, hey, are you sure you're all—",
        "Huh? Wait a second—",
        "You're being so...negative. I don't know what to say...",
        "Marianne! Do you mind if I ask you about something?",
        "It's about animal behavior. Among us all, you surely know the most about animals.",
        "I've read that in outdoor battles, wild animals can sometimes cause unexpected confusion. What do you think would be the best strategy to... Umm... Are you listening, Marianne?",
        "For crying out loud! Why do you always have to admit defeat before even giving yourself a chance?!",
        "This is beyond ridiculous. You're impossible! You seem convinced you're some sort of cursed being, destined to bring doom and gloom to anyone you encounter!",
        "Why do you have such a terrible opinion of yourself? How can you possibly be so dense?!",
        "Just nothing! Now you listen to me for a moment. I can see that you have some deep-seated turmoil that you struggle with. I'll have you know I have quite a few issues of my own. Perhaps more grave than yours, if you can imagine.",
        "Yes. But I'm not the only one who has such troubles to contend with. Everyone does. That's why it's so important to maintain a positive outlook and do what we can. Each time we find the light in the dark, we grow, bit by bit. And without growth, what's the point in carrying on?",
        "Don't envy me. Instead, just choose to find the positive, won't you?",
        "The time is now! This is your moment!",
        "That's more like it. Now to start, why don't you help me out by answering my questions about wild animals?",
        "I... I think I'm gonna pass out... Aghh!",
        "Yeah, I've been feeling really queasy all morning... I'm just heading back to my quarters to rest...",
        "Wuh... What? No...no... I'm not some sort of...infant.",
        "I'm feeling a bit better now. I should be OK from here. Thank you so much, Leonie. I hope I wasn't too heavy... Was I?",
        "Uh, training?",
        "Are you always thinking about training?",
        "Wouldn't that actually be...rather inefficient?",
        "Well, for example, if you're training for endurance, it seems running would be a better approach. If you're only ever training by cramming it in with other tasks, you won't be getting the best results. I am no expert on the subject, but even I can logic that one out.",
        "You've noticed, have you?",
        "That was nice of Leonie to check on me and carry me all the way to my quarters. And in the end, I just lectured her! She did thank me for it, but... Ugh, I probably could've handled that better.",
        "Uh, how about these? Just some old study notes of mine.",
        "Of course. It's all safely stored in my brain now. If I concentrate, I can access any of it with ease.",
        "Hm.",
        "No, that's not it. There's just...something I want to say to you. I'm sorry for saying your way of doing things was inefficient. You've clearly grown plenty strong, doing things as you have. Not to mention multitasking and training in that way surely presents interesting challenges.",
        "I haven't much choice—I can't waste even a single moment.",
        "Yes...",
        "You know, Leonie. You're so kind, so strong...",
        "I was just thinking what incredible partner you'd make. Really, you've got all of the perfect qualities!",
        "I'm not simply saying that. I say what I mean, and I mean what I say.",
        "Phew... That about wraps it up for today's training. No thanks to a certain distraction...",
        "Professor Hanneman, I know you're there. It's extremely unsettling the way you're always staring like that.",
        "Your half-hearted attempt to hide your weird staring only makes it weirder",
        "That might ease the weirdness, but it will continue to be extremely unsettling.",
        "I understand it well enough, and I'll do my best to ignore it, but in return...",
        "Shhh! Don't talk so loudly about it out here in the open!",
        "These awful Crests may seem miraculous to you, but for me, they fall under the category of curse.",
        "You are utterly lacking in empathy, you know that? Even if you spent your entire life \"observing\" me, you'd never understand my feelings and all I've been through. Now, if you'll excuse me.",
        "Professor Hanneman, is this a good spot for this book?",
        "It's no trouble. After all, it's proper etiquette for the young to help the elderly.",
        "I've been feeling well enough, all things considered.",
        "Here he goes with the \"positive\" again. Looks like your research is more useless than I thought.",
        "You just can't see beyond the Crests, can you? In all your research, haven't you considered that my abilities are a direct result of the effort I've put in?",
        "My efforts far exceed those of any other student—I've placed top priority on growing as quickly as possible.",
        "It has nothing to do with talent! It's a question of sheer will. I'm determined to succeed, no matter the sacrifice.",
        "I have goals, just like anyone. And precious little time in which to achieve them.",
        "The people who made me as I am informed me that my life would be drastically shortened as a result.",
        "A person bearing two Crests, against the will of nature itself... Well, clearly it can't be sustainable. As such, I don't indulge in the luxury of fantasizing about the future. I haven't got one. Knowing all this now, will you still claim that my Crests are something \"positive\"?",
        "I'll be leaving now.",
        "Did you want something, Professor Hanneman?",
        "I'm the one who should apologize. I'm sorry for being rude to you. Anyway, I'll keep going along with your research. I have to be on my way now.",
        "Correct.",
        "What is it you're implying?",
        "Crestology, of course.",
        "Why would you want to do such a thing?",
        "Huh...",
        "Do you think...removing a Crest could mean that they won't suffer from its effects any longer?",
        "Do you... Could you really do that?",
        "Professor Hanneman, I think I'm the one who should be asking for your help, really. Anyway, I'm sick of a Crest determining a person's worth too.",
        "If you do manage to restore my lifespan, I'd certainly think about it.",
        "Did you hear the thunder just now? Good thing we got all the clothes indoors before all the skies opened up. I apologize for troubling you with this task.",
        "It's just...odd. Every time it's my turn to wash the clothing, there's a sudden downpour. Surely it must be an inconvenient coincidence, but I can't help feeling as though I'm somehow to blame for it.",
        "Wow, you're even harsher than I am!",
        "I do, yes, but—Hold on a moment. How did you know that?",
        "How had I never connected this? This is quite a revelation! A Crest affecting the weather!",
        "I suppose that's true. So...we must test our hypothesis! Hmm... Maybe we can find someone who tends bring the sunshine around—that would be especially handy for helping out with the wash.",
        "I do. What do you need to speak with me about?",
        "Hm, yes. We never did get to test that theory, since I haven't found any sun-bringing folks.",
        "Certainly, but I don't see your point.",
        "Er, um, well...",
        "It's nice to know that someone understands...",
        "That can't be true, can it?! Stop messing with me!",
        "I don't even know the meaning of the word.",
        "Well... Thank you. Why are you being so kind to me, anyway?",
        "I see. I will say I'm happy to have someone around who actually seems to understand me.",
        "Aww. I...I really like that. Someone as wonderful as you as my big sister?",
        "Uh, what are you doing, Cyril?",
        "You can't expect to carry all these by yourself. Let me help.",
        "I'm well aware. You should accept the help being offered. I'm older and wiser— I know best.",
        "Yep, totally fine. I'm just kinda losing my grip on this log. Agh! Well, that wasn't much help, as it turned out. I didn't realize they'd be that heavy. Couldn't even walk in a straight line...",
        "I feel foolish.",
        "Hang on— shouldn't you rest for a bit?",
        "In that case, let me help you carry the chopped wood!",
        "You can't be serious!",
        "Our worlds aren't so different. We're together right now, aren't we?",
        "Hey, Cyril! Cyril? Hmm. What is he staring at? I see... Hey, what are you looking at there? Anything interesting? Let me have a look.",
        "\"3 apples, 2 bags of ointment, 1 piece of graphite.\" Intriguing... Some sort of code, perhaps?",
        "Oh, that's all? Sorry for interrupting, in that case. This is kind of a one-person job, so I won't bother you by offering aid.",
        "Is that so? But why do you keep it a secret?",
        "You're always welcome to call on me for help. I'd be happy to.",
        "I really mean that. Anything you need.",
        "Good! Now, you'd better go get those supplies before it gets dark. Do you remember everything on the list? Need me to read it one more time for you?",
        "All right, listen up! I'm not gonna do this a third time!",
        "What's up, Cyril?",
        "Looks like it's another shopping list. I'm happy to help you out. Did you try looking it over yourself yet?",
        "Have a look here— any of these letters look familiar?",
        "Yes, you got it! See? You can do it!",
        "It's clear you've got a sharp memory. If you apply yourself, you'll be reading in no time. Reading is such an important skill. Once you learn, you won't forget! And I won't be around to read things for you forever.",
        "Anyway, don't you enjoy learning? It seems like you haven't even thought of trying prior to this. Do you simply not have time for it?",
        "It seems like a hassle at this point not to learn, so you may as well start putting in the work!",
        "You do?",
        "As a matter of fact, they haven't! Stop messing with me!",
        "Excuse you! I mean, honestly!",
        "Don't expect me to read for you again! And, uh...just take care of yourself, will you?",
        "What's this letter all about... Doesn't appear to have a sender written anywhere... This hand writing is so sloppy. Wow.",
        "\"Dear Lysithea. I read the book you gave me.\"",
        "This must be from Cyril! He's learning so quickly!",
        "\"It was hard. And it got more easy more I tried it. And it was fun. And I learned new stuff.\"",
        "That's the spirit!",
        "\"Thanks you for helping me to read and to write.\"",
        "You are so welcome.",
        "\"Somethings are hard to say and easy to write.\"",
        "I know just what you mean.",
        "\"I want to read more and learn writing better.\"",

        "\"I am glad you are my friend. It makes me bappy.\"",
        "Cyril! You sweet, little—",
        "Some feelings can't be verbalized or put into writing. Just... Look, it's just that... I...",
        "What I'm trying to say is, \"I'm bappy too.\"",
        "Let's keep studying and spending time together, OK?",
        "What are you on about this time?",
        "Yes. But why are you asking?",
        "I would ask that you refrain from paintring them with the same brushstrokes that you so liberally paint yourself with. My mother and father will carry on with all the associated duties befitting of nobles. Only after that they will retire.",
        "Would you just stop. You're embarrassing me.",
        "I'm sure you had your reasons.",
        "Repaying your perceived debt would be nice, sure, but it sounds like you intend to foist your responsibility on to your little brother.",
        "Uh-huh...",
        "Just what exactly are you planning on in terms of this... repayment?",
        "Even though you're a lowlife?",
        "You're irresponsible and unreliable, but clearly, you're not a bad person. And your support would be most appreciated. Just so you're aware, however, we have no means with which to pay you. So are you sure you're still willing to follow through with this?",
        "Excuse me Just what are you insinuating?"

I can't even find my— Where in blazes is my underwear?! Oh, I— What is my dressing robe caught on? I can't tie this properly! It's not even covering— Oh, Manuela... This will have to do...",
        "Ahh, hello. Sorry to have kept you waiting. So... What do you want?",
        "Excuse me? You had a reason for coming here, I assume. I've put a lot of time and effort into making it possible to talk with you, you know...",

        "You heard from him? The fella from last night?! Huh. What did he have to say?",
        "Yeah... Figures. Kind of saw it coming, actually. That's why I came back to my room and went to bed. To get over it. Thank you...for checking in on me. Was that all you wanted? Well then, good night.",
        "Professor! A pleasure to see you.",
        "While I'm at it, may I confess something to you too?",
        "I realize what a burden I've been. On you, I mean. After every break-up, I neglect my work. And I know how that affects you. I'm completely worthless as a woman. Can you imagine how that feels? I'm going to be single for the rest of my life. I just know it. You think so too, don't you?",
        "What's wrong with me? It's not my looks. I'm still gorgeous. Or am I? Be honest. Do I look old? No... Not possible. I'm the songstress who swept the Empire off its feet... Men professed their love for me hourly! It can't be my looks.",
        "Oh no. If the problem isn't my looks—and they are not the problem—then it must be...what? My personality?",
        "I suppose I can be a bit...unkempt. I do have a short temper, and I may be a little lazy... Sometimes. But I've always heard fellas, you know, like a woman with a few flaws. Seems to me, there are plenty of flawed girls who have landed themselves a good man. So maybe...my trouble is I'm not imperfect enough. Do you think I could use a few more flaws?",
        "''''Are you saying I'm perfect as I am? Come now. You'll make me blush...",
        "...So I said, \"Two can play at that game!\" I told him, \"A smalltime, little weasel like you oughta be begging me for attention!\" Oh, it gets me so mad. So worked up! Why aren't there any men around here who understand what a catch I am? Come to think of it... You've always been nice to me. I mean, you listen to all my problems... I feel like I can really trust you. I don't have that kind of thing with a lot of people.",
        "I'd like to maybe talk about this once the war is over. Once we're all safe. All right, enough of this moping around! What we need is a change of mood! We've still got a lot to do together. When I think about that, what are one or two men?",
        "What's wrong is—it's not just one or two men. It's more like one hundred men! Maybe even two hundred! More! I'm... I'm completely... Ugh! I can't get out of this mood! Actually, I've got an idea. Exercise will help! I'm going to the training ground. Come on and give me a hand! Gonna work my anger out on one hundred training dummies. Maybe two hundred if we got 'em.",
        "Oh... Are you sure you should be here? There must be tons of young girls falling over themselves just to get near a hero like you. Or are you not interest in such attention?",
        "What?! Not looking for romance, then? So that's why you never gave in, no matter how many times I tried... Listen. I get it. No need to explain anything. It's better this way. It means I wasn't the problem.",
        "Wait. Am I the problem? I suppose if I had some charm, maybe you would have fallen for me. Oh... Why does this always happen to me?",
        "I'm not surprised. You can probably have your pick...",
        "W-what...",
        "Have you gotten me confused with someone else?",
        "Look, you don't need to take pity on me, OK? Or... That's not it, is it? I can see it in your eyes. Nobody's looked at me that way in a long, long time. I sound like a schoolgirl, but this is the moment I've always dreamed of. So, of course I'm going to mess it up by not knowing how to answer.",
        "Just...give me a minute to compose myself. OK... Come on, Manuela... Oooh... That's better. So my answer... Yes! Yes, I would love to marry you!",
        "'''I'm a complete mess, and I'll be a massive pain to you from now on... But in exchange for the trouble, I promise to give you all of my love. So don't let me down, you hear? You know... Until this moment, I didn't realize how much my heart longed to call you my own. I want to love you, and to be loved by you. I want...to share my life with you. And you really like that idea? '''' Oh! Oh, goodness! Oh, I just giggled. Maybe I'm not as old as I tell myself... Or maybe you just make me feel good about myself, my darling.'''",
        "I... Who... Oh, settle down and stop with the knocking. I'll be there in two shakes.",
        "Oh, dear... Professor? Is that you? I...just a moment. Manuela, you simply must quit...oversleeping. Hold on. Where are my clothes? I can't even find my— Where in blazes is my underwear?! Oh, I— What is my dressing robe caught on? I can't tie this properly! It's not even covering— Oh, Manuela... This will have to do...",
        "Ahh, hello. Sorry to have kept you waiting. So... What do you want?",
        "Excuse me? You had a reason for coming here, I assume. I've put a lot of time and effort into making it possible to talk with you, you know...",
        "No, you've done nothing wrong. Let's just say I'm not having a good day. Actually, I didn't have a good night... Never mind! What did you want, anyway?",
        "You heard from him? The fella from last night?! Huh. What did he have to say?",
        "Yeah... Figures. Kind of saw it coming, actually. That's why I came back to my room and went to bed. To get over it. Thank you...for checking in on me. Was that all you wanted? Well then, good night.",
        "Professor! A pleasure to see you.",
        "While I'm at it, may I confess something to you too?",
        "I realize what a burden I've been. On you, I mean. After every break-up, I neglect my work. And I know how that affects you. I'm completely worthless as a woman. Can you imagine how that feels? I'm going to be single for the rest of my life. I just know it. You think so too, don't you?",
        "What's wrong with me? It's not my looks. I'm still gorgeous. Or am I? Be honest. Do I look old? No... Not possible. I'm the songstress who swept the Empire off its feet... Men professed their love for me hourly! It can't be my looks.",
        "Oh no. If the problem isn't my looks—and they are not the problem—then it must be...what? My personality?",
        "I suppose I can be a bit...unkempt. I do have a short temper, and I may be a little lazy... Sometimes. But I've always heard fellas, you know, like a woman with a few flaws. Seems to me, there are plenty of flawed girls who have landed themselves a good man. So maybe...my trouble is I'm not imperfect enough. Do you think I could use a few more flaws?",
        "Why? Do you think I'm flawed enough already?",
        "...So I said, \"Two can play at that game!\" I told him, \"A smalltime, little weasel like you oughta be begging me for attention!\" Oh, it gets me so mad. So worked up!

        "♪ Mmm... Mmm... Mmm... ♪",
        "♪ Mmm... Mmm... ♪ Ah! Hello, Edelgard.",
        "Why, yes! You must have seen me there. I am flattered you would remember it! I performed with the Mittelfrank Opera Company in Enbarr on numerous occasions.",
        "Oh... That's a shame. So, you only got to hear me sing once?",
        "Yet you still remember it...even the melody of the song I sang. I'm honored.",
        "Indeed. Many singers perform for decades. But that wasn't for me. I wanted to go out on top. My voice is a gift from the goddess. However, as all things do, it will decline with age. One day, I will lose that gift. And so I decided I needed to learn to survive without it, long before that day came. I needed to prove to myself that I can live on... even after my voice returns to the goddess.",
        "It's hard for me to explain. The goddess supports me both spiritually and emotionally. Everything else is up to me.",
        "Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Why? Is something the matter?",
        "Please don't ask for the details. Suffice to say my room always looks like this after I've been dumped.",
        "Your help was unexpected, but appreciated, Edelgard. Now, what can I do for you?",
        "I suppose it was rather obvious, wasn't it? Perhaps I should stop being quite so dramatic... All the same, dear, I'd like to repay you for helping me out. Name your prize.",
        "Of course. What is it?",
        "Did I say that? Hm, I suppose so... From joining the Mittelfrank Opera Company to becoming a diva of the grand stage... I went through so much to achieve what I did. Looking back, I don't know how I made it.",
        "A lot. My divinely gifted voice only got me to the edge of the stage. From there, I had to work hard to defeat my rivals. I did all of this by myself, through sheer force of will. All so I could stand center-stage.",
        "Something on your mind, Edelgard? This may not be the best place to sit and think. An archer might try to take a lucky shot at you.",
        "I understand completely. May I ask what was on your mind? I'd like to help.",
        "Perhaps... I suppose that might be the only way for you to achieve your goals.",
        "Don't worry yourself about that, Edelgard. People are always weaker than you think, but never as weak as you expect. The goddess is our silent foundation. She watches over our every step, but never gets directly involved. You, on the other hand, want to support us with your own flesh and blood. To push us forward toward a better future.",
        "As it were, some problems require drastic measures. I believe you know that better than anyone. It takes strength to take those measures. That's why you inspire people. You're probably why some of them get out of bed in the morning.",
        "Nah, I've just been around a bit longer than you, that's all. While we're on the subject... Yes, the goddess does supply me with emotional support. But so do you. Whether you know it or not.",
        "Just what I said, my dear. Just what I said.",
        "As you wish. I think I've said quite enough as it is!",
        "Cicadas? Those noisy little bugs that swarm about? Endlessly mingling with one another?",
        "Migrating birds... Never sticking around for long. Always off to find love somewhere else...",
        "Oh, Ferdinand. You're just not yourself today. You don't seem focused. Your poetry...lacks poetry. Perhaps a break is in order.",
        "Pardon me?",
        "Why...yes. We are, aren't we?",
        "Is that a fact?",
        "'''' I see. So, what did you think?",
        "There's no need to be nervous, Ferdinand. That songstress you recall...is long gone. I get nervous too, you know. But I want you to feel relaxed around me. Understood?",
        "You're really full of surprises, you know that? I assumed you'd be more interested in combat than the arts. Come and chat sometime? I'd love to hear more about how my performances mesmerized you.",
        "Hmm... Let's see... Has to be here somewhere...",
        "Ferdinand... You should probably settle down a little with the \"princess\" talk. Just speak to me normally. My \"princess\" days are long gone.",
        "You're going a little overboard. And I... I think I may have something in my eye.",
        "I inspired your love of weaponry? How...flattering?",
        "Oh, come now... Although I'm honored if my stage presence had any such influence on your life.",
        "Oh, nothing. I just feel a little empty inside now...",
        "Oh, Ferdinand! That song...",
        "Ferdinand. That's called changing the subject. That song you were singing, is it the one you said made such an impression on you?",
        "You've nothing at all to be embarrassed about! I'm pleased if one of my songs stayed with you like that. Ahhh, it really takes me back. I remember the big battle in the first act...",
        "♪ How the crimson rain of pain it came, falling hard upon a land aflame. When the sacred blade it split the sky, until the heavens heard our cry... ♪",
        "♪ In the hour of vengeance, will you heed the call? On the red fields of revenge, will you help avenge? We must fight strong and stand tall! ♪",
        "Wow. My heyday is behind me, that's for sure.",
        "All right, Ferdinand. Relax. I can see that it's affected you deeply.",
        "Another one? And what would that be?",
        "I'm sure I can't do it as well now as I could then. But you're just so adorably...you. I can't resist.",
        "I gotta say, Ferdinand, you're full of surprises. It was like dancing with a pro. Perfect timing, always in step...",
        "Or perhaps it was you who inspired me.",
        "Too true, Dorothea. We hardly have a moment to spare here. But it's nice to see you flourishing. It certainly brings back memories. You know, somehow you've gotten even prettier. The years have been kind to you.",
        "Ha! Oh, honey. If that's the case, I hope you'll work hard to never become a rose like me. Too many thorns.",
        "That's a very nice sentiment and I appreciate it. Thank you.",
        "I know you didn't have any family connections. How'd you do it?",
        "Well, bravo and well-done. You've always had to find your own way in life, haven't you? I so wish you could rely on people more often... Still though, you haven't said why you worked so hard to get into Garreg Mach to begin with.",
        "Oh... Oh my. I... I don't know what to say.",
        "And have you gotten what you were after? Your dreams, a future... and a good partner?",
        "Ughhh... My head is pounding. You'd think I'd get used to this... Ughh...",
        "I'm completely hopeless.",
        "I was so proud of being the reason you came to Garreg Mach. Dorothea wanted to follow in my footsteps! How great is that? I thought I'd use that as an inspiration to straighten myself out. Be less of a, you know, less of a disgrace. But here I am, right in front of you, dealing with the worst hangover I've had in weeks.",
        "Wait, you mean you knew?",
        "Dorothea. My brain's pounding as it is. Please stop. It's all true, but I can't handle hearing it from you, the girl who I thought I had inspired to greatness. I can't believe I tried so hard to be a good example for you when you knew all along... I should leap into the ocean and drown.",
        "Thank you, Dorothea. That means a lot.",
        "Dorothea? You look as if something's terribly wrong.",
        "And tell me, what is your vision of the future like?",
        "Ha, well... I quit the opera to join the Officers Academy as a professor... Then I joined this war because... I don't know. I'm hoping for an end to it. Peace for the world. Even though I took control of my own fate, I still haven't found the man of my dreams.",
        "So, you've got a dream after all?",
        "I don't get it.",
        "I have to tell you something. The first time I saw you on stage, I felt you were the one I wanted to hear sing. I already had plans to leave the opera company, but when I met you... I knew I couldn't leave until I saw you take your rightful place. You're right though. It would have been nice to stand beside you on stage, even just once.",
        "What do you mean by that?",
        "Huh. You know... That could be nice. It'd be like you and me, finally together on stage... The light shining down, our gowns and jewels sparkling. Just us...",
        "Ugh... My head. Where? Why am I here instead of the infirmary? When did I? Oh boy.",
        "Sylvain? What do you need at this hour?",
        "That doesn't sound like me. Wait, no... I remember. The truth is, something sad happened, so I did what I always do to forget my troubles...",
        "And what were you doing in the infirmary late at night? Not bringing a girl there, I hope.",
        "Ugh, my poor head...",
        "What a thoughtful young man you are. You're a real gentleman compared to that jerk who just–",
        "Oh no! Did I...say those things to you?",
        "Oh dear.",
        "You're a smooth talker even when you don't mean what you say. I'm going to change, so shoo, OK?",
        "Thank you, Sylvain. I'm going to try and get some sleep.",
        "Did he just call me Manuela and not professor? That sly little– Although... Hmmm. Me? With Sylvain? Now there's a crazy thought.",
        "I must admit. That Sylvain is quite handsome... And it doesn't hurt that he's heir to a noble family. I could get used to that kind of life. The age difference bothers me a bit, but I'm sure it would be fine after a few years. At first it was hard to imagine myself with him, but now that I've thought about it, maybe—",
        "Speak of the devil. I think that's him over there.",
        "OK. That was just...repulsive. He is insincerity personified. No way I'd ever fall for that. He is handsome...and does come from good stock... But, no. I can't imagine we'd have a bright future together. I suppose the goddess does not give with both hands, does she?",
        "Wait. Could that mean because of my looks and my singing voice... That I'll never find true love?",
        "Please, Goddess, I'm begging you!",
        "Ah, Lorenz. Do you have a moment to spare, my dear?",
        "I am quite well, quite well. Thank you for asking. You are always such a gentleman.",
        "I was wondering if we might spend a little time together. Maybe, chat a bit?",
        "Oh, that would be just lovely. Lorenz, I hope you won't think it too forward of me, but... I was wondering if you could explain a poem to me? It goes like this... Verdant rains soothe... My aching heart like a cherished friend... Amid time's flow I mourn... Bonds I'm not sure I can ever rend... As my mind clings to desperate thoughts... Here it comes, Horsebow Moon and summer's end...",
        "As I suspected. I've checked absolutely everyone's handwriting. It's a sad poem though, isn't it? Feels lonely. Possibly even, dare I say, defeated. What makes you feel that way, Lorenz? Why aren't you happy? I very much want to know.",
        "I found it. And when I saw the words, I read them. That's what people do when they see words. They read them.",
        "Oh, dear. Snatching at something someone else is holding. How violent. It's not like you to lose your composure, Lorenz.",
        "I'm afraid I could never forget that peek into the darkness of your soul. Nor would I want to.",
        "Don't feel embarrassed! No! Be proud. It's a lovely piece of writing. Quite revealing. I'd never guess you'd have such hidden depths. Tell me more.",
        "Oh, that's absolutely adorable. So bashful. I simply must hear more of his poetry sometime soon.",
        "♪ Amid time's flow I mourn... Bonds I am unsure I can ever rend... ♪",
        "♪ As my mind clings to desperate thoughts... Here it comes, Horsebow Moon and summer's end... ♪",
        "Oh, Lorenz! I heard you shout. Are you OK?",
        "And I told you it would be impossible for me to forget.",
        "Oh, yes! It makes for a beautiful song, doesn't it? I'm feeling so lonely and blue. My dearest has left. He is gone far away, and I'm here. All alone. And in my sadness, your poem... Well, it became a song for me to sing. It brought me a moment of happiness...",
        "Oh. I understand. You're leaving me too. Why? Am I too old to matter?",
        "\"Mature,\" he says. I knew it. You're all the same, you know. No one sees the person behind the voice. They just see me older today than yesterday. They say, \"Oh, look what happened to her.\" Nobody sees my frustration, my resignation to be forever alone. But you do. It's all right there in your poem.",
        "Lorenz... I was sure the poem was more about someone lamenting their frailty and the loneliness of time's passing. But that's not it at all, is it? This is the story of someone impatient to get ahead. Who is afraid they'll never make it.",
        "Lorenz... Someday you should let me sing this song in public. I think people who are battling through their own trials...they might find comfort in this. And I believe I'm the only one who can do your work justice.",

        "Did you hear me just now? What did you think?",
        "Well, I guess I have my fair share of life experience. So long as you're not implying I'm old...",
        "Interpretation? When I sing, I am not interpreting. I'm scarcely thinking at all. I simply yield my heart to the poetry, and the emotion follows naturally.",
        "Of course. Next time I'll perform a private show. Just the two of us...",
        "Never. I wasn't mocking you. In fact, I'd like to see more of your poetry.",
        "I'd like to use it for another song. I promise that when it's done, you'll be the first to hear.",
        "That doesn't matter. The words are unadorned... the feelings so direct. Your poems have touched my heart. They are so true to life.",
        "Oh my. I can hardly wait. Is this the next part of the poem I was singing just now?",
        "Unpolished? No, Lorenz. It's beautiful. Thank you. To think that my voice inspired you... Yet it's you who inspires my voice. I'm so excited to start a new song!",
        "Oh, hello, Seteth. I must apologize, but I am quite busy. Perhaps we could talk another time?",
        "My explanation? For what?",
        "Oh, my dear Seteth. You must relax that worried brow. Those forehead creases will ruin your beauty.",
        "What question is that? The one you already know the answer to? Last night, I had a bit of fun, and a bit of drink. Less of one and more of the other, sure. But...",
        "Oh, don't oversell it. All they did was walk with me back to my room.",
        "I'd like to think I'd remember that. If it happened— and it probably didn't—it's not as if I'm heavy. Nobody hurt themselves. Did they? Come on, Seteth! Loosen up. If you're so worried about how I'll behave, why don't you join me for a drink sometime? I mean, I only get in trouble when I drink alone...",
        "Well, that sounds just delicious. What are you doing tonight around—",
        "That is just... You know, getting lectured by you is, well, I think the word is \"torture.\" Yes. That's it. Torture. And I won't have it. I'm going to go get a drink and try to forget this ever happened.",
        "Oh! Seteth. Hello.",
        "Praying? No, no. I was just...resting. Whenever I'm in the infirmary, I simply cannot get out of doing work. I need a place to sit and close my eyes.",
        "No, I was— Oh, I was just enjoying some old memories. That's all. In fact, I was just thinking about when my parents first brought me here as a child. I wandered off from my parents because I heard a beautiful voice. It was a woman. Singing. Somewhere just out of sight. I began to sing along, hoping she would hear me and that we might meet. I never found her, whoever she was. Yet it was she who taught me I could sing.",
        "I've never told anyone else, but I believe it was the goddess I heard. And that day, she gifted me my singing voice. And I thank the goddess for leading me back here after I left the opera company.",
        "That's very sweet coming from you, Seteth. Should I take that to mean that you like your ladies pious and respectable?",
        "Oh, it's a joke. Look, I'm just no good at serious conversations. Although I would be lying if I said I wasn't interested in knowing what kind of woman does get your attention.",
        "Quiet? Proper?! There's no need to be cruel, Seteth!",
        "Seteth?",
        "You surprised me, is all. Though not as surprised as you, when you found me here before. I've never seen you offering up prayers so solemnly.",
        "Really? Then what were you doing?",
        "I had no idea you held such a passionate secret devotion, Seteth. The legends of Saint Cethleann do depict her as a kind, proper, and honorable woman... And she was so gentle and quiet. Really kept to herself. It's no wonder you're infatuated with her.",
        "It must be very lonely to be so in love with someone from the distant past.",
        "You don't have to hide it from me, Seteth. I can keep a secret. But people from the past are gone. No matter how much you care for her, she can't love you back. Now then, if you turned your eyes to me...I could respond to your deepest, most powerful feelings.",
        "Oh, I won't expose your passion to the light of day. I told you I can keep a secret.",
        "What kind of story? Is it about your past? Because there's a story I could enjoy hearing.",
        "You had a wife and a daughter? Why would you have kept that secret?",
        "Hmm... Your story doesn't sound right to me. I don't mind saying it.",
        "When you talked about your ideal woman before, your description was almost exactly Saint Cethleann. Now you're telling me your daughter is a perfect match?",
        "Do it again! Say \"the way of the world\" with a serious face! You're so stern and proper, but you really can be quite funny. I love a man who can make me laugh.",
        "I sound like your late wife? Don't tell me... I actually resemble her, don't I? Mirror image, I bet.",
        "The way you say it, I suppose I must resemble her a little. Well, isn't that an honor. Say, Seteth. Have you ever considered remarrying? You know, just so you're not alone?",
        "It's been a long time since your wife passed, right? You should start thinking about it. There could be someone who finds you handsome. Someone close by. Maybe even right in front of you.",
        "I'd be happy to help you mull it over, if you like. How about tonight? We could go out for a drink...",
        "Whatever are you talking about, Flayn?",
        "It makes me happy to hear, but who told you that?",
        "Your request is touching, but I can't perform on such short notice. My voice is an instrument and requires proper, gentle care. However, the stories are true. I was once the leader of the Mittelfrank Troupe. But that was a long time ago.",
        "You've never heard of the Mittelfrank Troupe? It's the single most popular opera company in the Imperial capital! I used to sing on stage with them. I was the star, in fact. Before the war, it was the single most popular opera company in the Imperial capital! I used to sing on stage with them. I was the star, in fact.",
        "You used to live in Enbarr?",
        "Ah, well, you must have been too young to hear about us.",
        "You don't know what an opera troupe is? Well... It's a group of performers, like myself, who act out stories on stage, in front of a big audience. Stories with lots of singing.",
        "That is darling, Flayn. But I'm not sure it's quite the same thing as an opera. You see... Operas are performed in grand theaters, with orchestral accompaniment. Everyone attending wears their finest. It is a very special occasion.",
        "You've never even heard of a theater? You're an intelligent girl, Flayn, and the world is full of wonders. You have a lot left to discover.",
        "My, how bold to ask an adult about their private life. I'll humor you though... A diva's life is only glamorous while she's on stage. The rest of her time is consumed by grueling training. Just days and days of practicing, beginning at sunrise, with barely a moment to rest from one performance to the next. Then, once the performances begin, you're on stage for three shows a day. Absolutely exhausting. Is that anything like you imagined?",
        "Yes, I was a princess once or twice. And it was quite something, let me tell you. All those royal jewels and flowing gowns... And they didn't just give me the pretty clothes to wear because I was beautiful, you know. I had to fight and claw my way into every role. But once I was there on stage, singing my solo, and all eyes were on me? It was worth it. I was rewarded for every one of my countless hours of practice. And the cheers when I finished a song! The applause! Oh, I can't properly explain it, but I can tell you it's an experience I will cherish until the day I die.",
        "There's a lot to be said for the quiet life. It was never for me, of course. Still...I hear it's a pretty good deal for a lot of other folks. The thing is, Flayn... Well... You always have to remind yourself that if a place shines brighter than anywhere else, its shadows will be darker too.",
        "Heh, nothing. Nothing. It's a thing I hope you never come to understand. You know what? The next time you visit, I'll tell you all about the time I played a beautiful princess... and about the handsome prince she fell in love with!",
        "You sound so worried. That was nothing, dear. Call it a joke.",
        "Well, I suppose I could share a little. Here's the thing about the opera. Talent isn't enough to earn you a position in a glamorous show. You need money, connections, and, failing those, the stomach to commit a spot of violence. I spent many nights buttering up nobles in power. No matter how humiliating the task, I'd do it. Because I wanted to be a star. I hope that kind of talk isn't too shocking for a sweet girl like yourself. Are you disillusioned with me now that you know my sordid past?",
        "Flayn...",
        "You sound very wise all of a sudden. Thank you, Flayn.",
        "Your request to hear one of my songs?",
        "I don't know about that. It's been a long time since I stood on stage. I imagine you have experienced much since you left the opera company.",
        "Yes, I probably could play a tragic role even better now than I could back then. But it's hardly the time for operas. We need to put an end to this war first.",
        "That is exactly what I yearn for!",
        "Ugh...",
        "Hanneman, isn't it a bit rude to tell others how to behave? Besides, I could be sighing about any number of things more interesting than you.",
        "Well, listen to the noble lecturing a lowly commoner to be on her best behavior. Oh. Wait. I meant to say \"the former noble\".",
        "You're not done lecturing yet? Leave me alone and go pester someone else. Maybe leave everyone alone and go focus on your precious Crest research.",
        "Oh, was that a sigh I heard? Isn't it a bit rude to sigh at someone just because–",
        "Keep a hand on– Well, I've never– What makes you think you're so much better? Just because you keep your emotions bottled up behind your stupid stony face, well, it doesn't mean everyone else has to do the same! Stop telling everyone how to behave, Hanneman. It will make you, and the rest of us, much happier.",
        "Go on! If you think you can change me, I'd like to see you try!",
        "Hah! Thought so! You wouldn't dare.",
        "Oh, no, Hanneman. It is I who should be apologizing. I behaved in just the most dreadful, dreadful manner. I was just lashing out at everything... You were right to call me out. Really, and I do very much mean this, I'm so sorry for my behavior.",
        "Thankful?",
        "I could say the same thing, you know. Your accusations... They really hit home. After I cooled down, I realized you were right. I really ought to try and keep my emotions a bit more under control.",
        "Indeed. There's nothing more depressing than a pointless fight, is there?",
        "Heh... You're not wrong.",
        "Something the matter, Hanneman?",
        "Well, thank you for the compliment. Even if you did have to spoil it with criticism. If you weren't so judgmental all the time, maybe you'd have had more luck in romance yourself!",
        "And that so-called advice is exactly why I call you meddlesome and overbearing!",
        "And there's Hanneman, who said he was going to stop being so meddlesome! You and your...",
        "You keep doing things that aren't called for! It's driving me batty!",
        "Let's just not do this, shall we? I don't know why we always end up fighting.",
        "Perhaps this could even be considered a form of fate. What an awkward fate to have. I'd like you a lot more if I just hated you. All this fighting and making up is just...exhausting.",
        "What a waste of effort. We're absolutely hopeless, the both of us...",
        "But complete opposites work together too. Surprisingly well, sometimes. They compensate for each other's weaknesses, and they support one another...Then I look at how hard we work just to avoid screaming at each other, and I don't buy it.",
        "Huh. I suppose our differences do have their advantages that way.",
        "Huh. You might be on to something. You and I could be pretty good together... Wait! Why are we talking about this?! Are you trying to propose marriage? With promises of clean floors?! You think I'm that easy of a catch?! Honestly!",
        "Oh, so this is my fault now?! I never said a word about getting married!",
        "♪ The blue sea glimmers in the dark, the Red Canyon calls... ♪",
        "♪ Goddess, reach, in dreams... to her throne she falls... ♪",
        "Well, Gilbert... What do you think?",
        "Nobody could miss a good man like you.",
        "No, Gilbert. Hold on a moment. You're not disturbing me. Truly. I want very much to know what you thought of my singing. The least you can do is tell me.",
        "Lovely? Is that what you really feel? Please be honest.",
        "That is not the look of someone who just heard what they deemed to be lovely. It hurts my confidence when my voice can't even lure a fleeting smile to your face. It's as though my singing voice has died since stepping off the Mittelfrank stage...",
        "If that's the case, then, Gilbert, I challenge you to a duel! My singing versus your iron mask. I will break through, and I will see passion in your eyes!",

        "Huh?",
        "'''' ...",
        "Gilbert! How long have you been there?",
        "I don't usually let others watch me practice. Do understand that I was just practicing, Gilbert. It was not a perfect performance, so I demand you erase it from your memory immediately.",
        "Not again! How can you say that with such an expressionless... Gilbert?",
        "Gilbert...you're... You're smiling. My goodness!",
        "My...form?",
        "What just happened? I was only practicing and... A guarded, handsome, older man...and I'm the only lady who can raise a smile from him? Maybe you've still got it after all, Manuela. Maybe you do...",
        "Alois, what a pleasant surprise! Would you care to join me?",
        "My goodness, but you're in a good mood.",
        "Oh?",
        "Singing? Dancing? I've no idea what parents teach their kids, or why they even have children at all. Still, give me a hint. Fishing? Bricklaying? Cooking?",
        "The basics of...which?",
        "I don't know, and I don't care to know.",
        "Wouldn't your daughter appreciate it more if you took the time to savor—",
        "Not first best? Shouldn't you encourage her—",
        "Why would you say—",
        "You've forgotten I'm here, haven't you? All I wanted was a dinner companion. What did I do to deserve this?",
        "Alois, hello. You're looking more serious than usual. Is everything OK?",
        "I wouldn't know the first thing about buying a gift for a child, never having had one myself. Now, I must ask you to leave the infirmary. I need to make room for sick and injured patients, who I am sure will arrive at any moment.",
        "Young? D-did you just call me... Oh! Could you repeat that? Please?",
        "Well, your quite astute observations have inspired me. So, let's discuss your daughter's birthday gift.",
        "Very well. Now, let's begin with the simplest question. What does your daughter enjoy? What kind of gifts have you given her for previous birthdays?",
        "Excuse me?",
        "Oh. You don't think an ancient coin is much of a present, I take it.",
        "You know what, Alois? Don't you fret. I'll think of something that will make your daughter happy, and make up for all of your other gifts!",
        "Oh! Wonderful! I would've expected no less after the effort I put into finding the perfect gift.",
        "I shouldn't be reading your personal letters, Alois.",
        "Yes, I see you here, and... \"To the person who selected my gift\"?",
        "It wouldn't take a genius to figure it out after being sent dirty coins for so many years... Anyway, I guess that means I can carry on reading. ...That's a special girl you've got there. Your daughter really cares about you.",
        "I'm gonna cut you off, Alois. I don't have time for a story right now.",
        "Oh, there's a mountain of things I want, but nothing I can ask you to do. Reading your daughter's heartwarming letter was more than enough. I didn't help you out so I could have a knight owe me a favor. I just wanted to help a friend.",
        "I'm sorry? What do you mean \"the next\"?",
        "Don't push your luck, pal. Alois, I'll never understand how someone like you can find love, yet I'm still alone.",
        "This is unbelievable! Why? Why does it keep happening to me?! What's wrong with me?!",
        "I was sure I'd be happy this time! Why, oh why, oh why do I always struggle in love?",
        "If I let go, you'll just run away! Won't you?",
        "Nobody wants to listen to my romantic tragedy. But I saw you, Cyril, and I thought, \"Cyril will listen because Cyril is good people.\"",
        "I knew I could trust you, Cyril. You're such a good boy. Such a good young man.",
        "Oh, it's a real tragedy. Let me tell you that. Yesterday, I was hitting it off with a man I'd seen a few times at the pub... When I looked in his eyes, I thought he was the one. But then... Well, we were drinking and enjoying ourselves and all of a sudden... Poof! Gone! He just vanished. I feel like I've heard this story before... Can you believe he treated me so cruelly?",
        "My heart is in tatters! I can't believe anyone could throw away a woman like me! Cyril, be honest. What's wrong with me?",
        "Maybe he wasn't for me anyway.",
        "Right? I think you're too young to understand, but I also think talking to you made me feel better. Yeah! You know what, Cyril? I'm gonna come talk to you more often.",
        "Ugh... What'd I do to deserve pain like this?",
        "Stay! Right! There!",
        "Cyril! It must be a little dollop of destiny, meeting you here! Listen, you wouldn't leave me when I need a little help, would you?",
        "That's my boy, Cyril. You're a saint. I don't want to be trouble, but get me water. And medicine. Now. Please? Phew! I feel a bit better now. Thank you so much, Cyril. My sweet, dear, little Cyril.",
        "Oh, you know... Sometimes I'm upset, and... Well, that's it, really. It's not something a kid like you could understand. Maybe one day. Or not. Who knows. All I know is that my head aches...",
        "You can't understand heartbreak until you've felt it for yourself. But when you're older, your heart will break, and I'll make sure to be there...to get you water and all that.",
        "You're always so nice and sweet, Cyril. I'll pay you back. Promise.",
        "Oh, don't be shy!",
        "Hahaha! Oh, Cyril... What were you saying? I interrupted, I think."

        "What about you? Do you really believe that you accept whatever comes in life?",
        "How?",
        "I-I see... so that's what you believe. Do you... really think it's possible that someone like me has a purpose to fulfill?",
        "Oh! I'll give this some serious thought. Thank you, Ferdinand. Your words have deeply moved me.",
        "Mmm... delicious...",
        "Yes, Ferdinand. Of course.",
        "Um, is something wrong?",
        "That may be true.",
        "Please... you're making me blush...",
        "Well, I have you to thank for that. In truth, I spent a lot of time thinking about what you said. It meant so much when you told me that everyone has a purpose to fulfill. Even me.",
        "No, not yet... But I've been much happier since I started thinking about it more. I remembered a time back when I was working at the animal clinic. The rest of the staff was so thankful for the work I had done. Even in something as simple as looking after animals, I was able to make myself useful to others. Thinking about it made me realize that anyone can make other people happy. Even someone like me.",
        "What do you mean?",
        "You may be right! Ah! I just remembered! I wanted to ask about your food.",
        "Today was my turn to prepare the meal. How is it?",
        "I'm glad you like it.",
        "Oh?",
        "Of course! It would be my pleasure!",

        "Please! My adoptive father told me to keep it a secret! And I personally don't want it known!",
        "Please! Stop! Don't say another word! No one should know about or even speak of my crest. Nothing good comes of it. It's even the reason my parents disappeared. This crest only brings bad luck to anyone who comes near me. Even you, Linhardt. You have to stay away.",
        "No! You shouldn't be so cavalier about something you couldn't possibly understand! I - I have to go.",
        "These ones look good. I probably shouldn't pick them though...",
        "Oh! Y-yes, Linhardt. Um... I've found which vegetables are ripe and ready, but would you mind picking them for me?",
        "I'm just afraid that if I touch them, well...",
        "Yes. It's true. I wouldn't want anybody to suffer because of me.",
        "Thank you so much, Linhardt.",
        "Um, OK.",
        "Happiness? I don't understand.",
        "I-I suppose so, when you put it that way. But I-",
        "I'm sorry, but I can't. I have to decline.",
        "I don't think that's a good idea, but if you insist.",
        "Oh! Linhardt! Um, I was just on my way to pray.",
        "It's already getting late though. If you'll excuse me. Hmm.",
        "Linhardt?! Were you here this entire time?",
        "I suppose. My apologies for keeping you waiting.",
        "I see. So... what did you want to talk about?",
        "Your... research?",
        "Are you sure? That's...",
        "Oh...",
        "That may be true...",
        "Ugh. You're going to make us both sick!",
        "Thank you for your reassurance. It does make me feel a little better.",
        "Your life? For me?",
        "Um...",
        "Actually...",
        "Um, Ashe? Does this key belong to you? I found it by the door.",
        "You're welcome. And my apologies for scaring you.",
        "No, that's OK. I guess I do look like one...",
        "Does that make me look scary?",
        "I'm sorry that I look so ghastly...",
        "Up? You mean like this?",
        "What did you say?",
        "Keep my head up and...smile? I'm sorry, but I don't think I can.",
        "Hm?",
        "I'm not praying. Only confessing.",
        "For everything about me...",
        "But that's-",
        "A Crest? I do, but it's-",
        "There's nothing great about it.",
        "No, I-I can't. You don't understand. This Crest is worthless! I'm sorry, but I must go.",
        "No, I was waiting for you.",
        "Um, I wanted to apologize. You kept trying to encourage me, but I just avoided you in return...",
        "Can I tell you something, Ashe?",
        "You said that my Crest is an extraordinary gift, but I don't agree with that at all. Don't people have more important qualities?",
        "Like, um, how much we help those around us. Or whether or not we can make other people smile?",
        "Sylvain says that a person's value is in their smile.",
        "That's not what I mean at all! I just don't know... I don't know how to find my dream...",
        "You'll help me?",
        "No, I would appreciate that. I want to find something worth working toward... Together. With you. And with my head held high.",
        "Oh, Sylvain. Yes, I was just heading back to my quarters.",
        "Um, I don't think I should.",
        "Please, you should not waste your time on me. Besides, my adoptive father requested that I not stray too far from the monastery.",
        "I...I don't really know you all that well, but I don't think it makes a difference. I mean, it doesn't really matter to me that you have a Crest.",
        "If you're going into town, please just go without me.",
        "I wonder what he meant by that...",
        "I'm not avoiding you. I'm just not very good at talking to people in general.",
        "Well, um...",
        "Huh? Their smile?",
        "Smile. Be strong-willed... How's this?",
        "Ch-cheese?",
        "Cheese... Are you sure this will make me stronger?",
        "I'll think about it...",
        "It's not that I don't like going into town. I'm just eager to get back to my room. I want to go practice my smile. If I keep practicing, maybe someday I'll be ready to go into town with you.",
        "I am, Lorenz. Thank you.",
        "Is that so? I feel fine.",
        "W-was there something you needed?",
        "Does something about me seem... off?",
        "I have very little in common with my adoptive father.",
        "I can't say that I know too much about him. I should be going now.",
        "Um. Well, I don't dislike them.",
        "I think i would rather stay. It would be for the best if you kept your distance from me.",
        "I would never compare myself to the beauty of the goddess.",
        "If you admire my handkerchief so much, you may have it.",
        "It was a gift from my adoptive father. I didn't choose it for myself. I'm sure I don't share his refined sensibilities though, considering how little he and I have in common. I have to go.",
        "Ah, um...",
        "I'm curious why you've been eating your meals near me as of late... I'm not much for conversation... I'm always at a loss for words... and I never know how to respond to questions.",
        "R-really?",
        "You think I'm beautiful... just the way I am?",
        "No one's ever said anything like that to me before...",
        "What a strange person... But being called beautiful just the way I am? That was nice to hear.",
        "Um, I'm a little busy right now. Maybe later tonight?",
        "Thank you for inviting me over.",
        "Oh! This tea tastes so good!",
        "Ah, it's sweet. It complements the astringency of the tea.",
        "You want to spend more time with me?",
        "Well that's... Actually there's something I need to say.",
        "I've been keeping this from you for a while. It's... It's about my Crest. It's just terrible. I --",
        "Oh!",
        "It-it's just...",
        "Hehehe! You're funny, Lorenz...",
        "This is the first time I've smiled in so long... and I have your kindness to thank for that.",
        "Hehehe! I'm looking forward to that.",
        "Huh? Oh. Um.",
        "No, thanks. I—",
        "I-I'm done eating now. I have to go.",
        "Oh, is that so? I'm so happy you found all of that food! A little grey starling told me that you can find berries if you fly out towards the mountains.",
        "What's that? You want to try some nectar from the flowers in the greenhouse? That might be tricky. I guess you could try it if I'm already there, otherwise you might get locked in.",
        "Eeek!",
        "Y-yes, it looks like he has. What are you doing here, Raphael?",
        "Uh, that's sweet of you, but... I'm fine.",
        "Excuse me?!",
        "Ah, um... yes.",
        "No, that's not it. This bird just happened to be... speaking human.",
        "Is that... Raphael?",
        "What?! He's talking to a bird!",
        "Um.",
        "It appears so.",
        "Birds are very cautious creatures. They tend to fly away when they're startled.",
        "Huh? I thought you were just talking to one?",
        "Huh...",
        "Now what am I supposed to do?",
        "Oh! Wh-what's wrong, Raphael?",
        "You're right. Um, do you mind if I handle this? Hello there, Mr. Bird. How do you do? Hmm... Yes, I see. I see. So your food supply is—",
        "I completely understand. I have seen more people and birds foraging for berries lately. It would be ideal if those berries were growing in another forest nearby. Then you wouldn't have to—",
        "Are those... bugs?! Yuck!",
        "That was... disgusting. But how did you know he was hungry?",
        "Oh. About that. I'm sorry, Raphael, but I need to tell you the truth. I can sort of understand what animals are thinking when I look at them, but I can't speak to them. I'm sorry for leading you on.",
        "I, um. Uh... no, Raphael. I can't.",
        "Ah! Nope, still can't do it!",
        "What do you mean?",
        "I'm so sorry, Raphael. I didn't know, I—",
        "What the—? Hahaha!",
        "Hahaha! Sorry, I didn't quite catch that one.",
        "Ah! I think I'll have to pass!",
        "Is that everything?",
        "That must have been frustrating to watch.",
        "It was no trouble. They landed right at my feet.",
        "Are you all right?",
        "It was nothing.",
        "Um...",
        "I'm sorry. I know I'm not much fun to be around. I'm not very good at small talk either.",
        "Huh? Oh! The flowers are lovely!",
        "How wonderful...",
        "Yes. Can I help you?",
        "Huh? Oh, um. I...",
        "So, um, did you need something from me?",
        "Have I done something?",
        "Um...",
        "Then, how will I know where I'm going?",
        "Oh! The town is glowing from the sunset.",
        "Very much so.",
        "But...why me?",
        "Oh, I...",
        "You could've just enjoyed it on your own...",
        "Thank you, I...I'm not sure what to say.",
        "I...I will. I really will.",
        "Oh, no. It was nothing.",
        "Well...",
        "I-I just couldn't keep up with the rest of the group... Everyone got so mad at me. They said something about looking into their eyes so I can read their movements, but I couldn't do it...",
        "I'm a hindrance to everyone... I just—I can't do it!",
        "Huh?",
        "You...you may be right. I was my fault for looking down. Thank you, Ignatz... I appreciate your encouragement.",
        "I can certainly try!",
        "I-is something wrong? Did I say something to upset you?",
        "Remarkable beauty?",
        "Um...",
        "L-Lysithea? What's all this commotion? What's happening?",
        "Oh no! But, I don't know how I...",
        "I... I don't think I would be of much help.",
        "I...",
        "I'm sorry! I can't do anything right!",
        "No, it's fine. I'm the one to blame.",
        "I'm the one who should apologize. All I did was get in your way. You would have made it to the training grounds much sooner if I hadn't slowed you down.",
        "It's all my fault. It's always my fault. The accident was probably my fault too!",
        "Yes?",
        "I was listening, I just don't think I can really—",
        "My advice would probably just put everyone in danger. You'd be better off without me.",
        "Well...",
        "I just—",
        "R-Really?",
        "Lysithea... I envy your confidence and strength.",
        "Yes. Well, maybe someday...",
        "Oh! OK!",
        "I'll certainly try my best.",
        "N-no, I don't mind it.",
        "I, umm, well...",
        "Um.",
        "I'm sorry, Hilda. I just didn't know the best way to organize the books while sorting.",
        "Wow, Hilda! That was incredible!",
        "Sorry. The least I can do is help you put them back on the shelf.",
        "E-excuse me. I have some more supplies that just arrived for the infirmary.",
        "I just have bandages and other small things, but there might be more coming.",
        "My apologies.",
        "Oh, OK. How can I help?",
        "I can try... Ah!",
        "I'm sorry. I—",
        "I can do that. Ah! Now the bandages fell!",
        "I'm sorry that I was no help. I just got in your way.",
        "You want me to get you pastries? I guess I can.",
        "You're right... I'm sorry.",
        "Um. Hilda? I wanted to thank you for helping me in the infirmary. I brought you these pastries...",
        "That sounds lovely, but... I also wanted to apologize for always causing you so much trouble.",
        "I suppose if you're enjoying yourself, then it can't be that bad.",
        "No, no. You're not boring at all. In fact, you're, um, very good at talking. You're also good with your hands. You can clean and organize better than almost anyone. I envy you...",
        "How do you mean?",
        "I'm sorry you always have to clean up after me...",
        "Oh, well...",
        "I'm so sorry. I just can't help it. When I imagine you doing those things, I—",
        "Hahaha! I'm so—haha!—so-sor-sor—",
        "Ah, yes. Ouch! Hot!",
        "I know. I'm sor—owowow! Hot!",
        "Being kicked must have hurt. Didn't it, Dorte? Do they think you won't gallop unless you're in pain? It must be difficult letting those brutes ride you.",
        "Ah! N-nothing.",
        "Is there something you need?",
        "Oh...",
        "No, no. I don't deserve that kind of praise.",
        "My adoptive father tells me I shouldn't stray too far from the monastery.",
        "I should stay. Besides, I wouldn't be much help. I don't think anyone would like whatever I pick out anyway. It would all go to waste. And I'm sure that having me around would just cause you misfortune, Leonie.",
        "I should stay here by myself...",
        "Um. Ah. Leonie?",
        "Oh. I...um. I'm sorry.",
        "Leonie, I...",
        "W-wait!",
        "It's. Um...",
        "I don't mean to bother you. I'm sorry for keeping you here.",
        "I've been avoiding people for most of my life, so I'm not the best at speaking.",
        "I make everyone uncomfortable. I just don't know how to carry on a conversation.",
        "Oh...",
        "OK, then. I, um... I like this flower. I think it's nice.",
        "Oh! Really? I'd like to see that.",
        "Oh, yes! That would be very exciting!",
        "I should head back.",
        "Oh! P-Professor Hanneman? Yes, I've just finished training for the day.",
        "Yes. I'm sorry. I should have done more...",
        "I, um...",
        "How did you find out?",
        "No, no. I have no talents.",
        "I...um...",
        "N-no! I refuse!",
        "P-Professor Hanneman? You wanted to speak with me?",
        "Of course...",
        "No, I...I would rather not.",
        "I'm not sure what you mean...",
        "I have no desire to make use of my Crest.",
        "Ever since I was born, that Crest has been nothing but a burden to me. My parents too.",
        "Uh...yes. It was my father.",
        "I don't...",
        "Accept it?",
        "Mine?",
        "I will... Um... I will think about that.",
        "Um... Professor Hanneman?",
        "I, um... I wanted your opinion on something.",
        "I'm beginning to feel that I should...accept who I am. I thought it might be time to change my training regiment...to utilize my Crest. Even if just a little.",
        "The truth is that I was already considering it before we spoke. All of my allies work relentlessly to achieve their goals, both on and off the battlefield. Seeing this, it occurred to me that I have nothing to work toward. I'm no use to anyone. If I could accept who I am, even a little, I might be able to change that. I was still considering, but after we spoke about it...well...",
        "I'm sorry. I know I'm not the best at communicating. But it's true... Your words gave me a lot to think about. They helped me come to this decision. Whatever my Crest, it should serve me.",
        "That's not to say I've accepted it completely... But I refuse to continue living in fear of myself!",
        "Of course. Your knowledge is much appreciated."

    "Mercedes": [
        "Good evening, Professor. Returning from work, I take it?",
        "Try not to overtax yourself, all right? I'm concerned for your health. We wouldn't want you to wear yourself out. The goddess won't smite you if you rely on others for help, you know.",
        "Listen here, Professor. You might not like what I'm about to say. To be perfectly honest, I had my doubts when I first met you.",
        "I don't want me to think less of me for saying this, but here we are.",
        "At first, I thought you seemed too young to be a professor. It is unusual, you have to admit. Yet, you seemed very composed and mature, despite your age. You're strong-willed, encouraging, and you go to great lengths to ensure that everyone is cared for. But it almost feels like you're trying too hard to be a perfect role model for your students.",
        "If that's how you feel, I can't disagree. But I think it's necessary to give yourself a break every now and again. The mind has a tendency to make mistakes when you've exhausted yourself. In my case, I still seem to make mistakes even when I'm wide awake.",
        "Oh, you know. I'm always mixing up the dates for drills or misplacing things. Just the other day, I forgot to put on my uniform and headed out to practice wearing only my — Oh, um. Well, you can imagine how embarrassed I was. My mind can be so scattered sometimes. Anyway... where was I? Ah, that's right. What I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't push yourself too hard. If you do, you might end up in a pretty bad place.",
        "That reminds me! Is there anything I can do to assist you, Professor? If it's all right with you, I'd like to help in any way I can.",
        "I look forward to helping you out.",
        "Well, hello there, Professor. Is this a friend of yours?",
        "Is that so? I was sure you two knew each other. Is there something we can do for you, good sir?",
        "Really? What's troubling you?",
        "How terrible! That's no good at all. May I be of assistance? I'd be happy to lend a shoulder and escort you to the chapel.",
        "We'll need your help too, Professor. Here, sir, take my arm.",
        "Splendid work, Professor. He really seemed to appreciate our assistance.",
        "Putting a smile on someone's face always seems to brighten up the day. Is something wrong? You're giving me a strange look.",
        "Oh. Hmm... How should I put this... I suppose it's just second nature to me.",
        "It's difficult to describe, but I can usually tell when someone is worried about something. Back there, I could tell that both you and the old man were in distress. I spent a good amount of my life living in the church. Maybe that's why I'm so good at identifying these things?",
        "Did I not mention that before? I spent nearly 10 years of my life in the church of Faerghus. Many came to us with their troubles. In my own time of need, I once ran to the church myself, and they helped me. May I share something with you, Professor?",
        "I'd like to work in the church one day. I want to be like the priest who helped me. Never mind. It's not a very realistic dream. Please, forget I said anything. If I were someone else, perhaps a commoner without a Crest or stature, maybe things would be different. It's a bit sad, but... this is the way things have to be. After all, only the goddess can decide our fates.",
        "Do you have a moment, Professor? I need to speak with you.",
        "Thank you so much. This is what I wanted to address... This letter from my adoptive father just arrived.",
        "Oh! Have I not mentioned him? He's the reason I first came to the Officers Academy. He's also the one who dragged me from the church where I was living just so he could use my Crest.",
        "My Crest does not yet belong to a house, so he plans to use it as leverage to marry into the nobility. He's a very greedy man who was a roving merchant before adopting me, but now he's in the capital. This letter says that he's finally arranged to marry me off to a wealthy noble. I know he's just thinking of himself, but can't he see that this isn't a priority when we're at war?",
        "Ugh! I don't know what to do about this proposal!",
        "I can't see any way around it, so I fear that I must... I just don't want to let go of the life that I've made for myself. I know it's not what my heart wants, but I don't have the strength to say no.",
        "I believe I've mentioned this before, but I want to work in service of the church. Well, I suppose it doesn't necessarily have to be the church, but I want to help those in need. If I were to marry a noble, I think it would be difficult to realize that dream...",
        "It's just... I've always allowed myself to follow the whims of those above me. I convinced myself that everything in life was at the will of the goddess. I was blind to reality. I believed it was her will to both pull me from the church and guide me to the Officers Academy. The decision to enter this war was the first time I acted of my own free will. My adoptive father opposed this decision, but I somehow managed to convince him.",
        "Still, I couldn't free myself of him completely. This letter is proof of that. It's not that I'm scared of him, but there is something that worries me...",
        "Ah! I knew you'd understand, Professor. I've sat down to write a reply several times, but I can't muster up the courage, or the words. I was hoping you could provide me with the encouragement I need!",
        "OK! I think that may have been just the push I was looking for! I'll tell him the truth. That I've found a life worth pursuing and I must decline the proposal! Maybe I should tell him I've fallen for someone else?",
        "Why, it's you, Professor! Isn't that obvious?",
        "I'm just teasing! Now, I'm off to write this letter and stand my ground! Thank you for your encouragement!",
        "There you are! I apologize for the short notice, but I'm so glad you could make it! I'm sure you're very busy, being the hero of Fódlan and all.",
        "Do you mind hearing me out?",
        "Ah! Great! Here it is...",
        "I'm going to Fhirdiad to meet with my adoptive father, and I'd like you to accompany me.",
        "I've already decided exactly what I'm going to say. I'm choosing to live my life how I want, in pursuit of my own happiness. I need you to accept that. I'm in charge of my own destiny. Not you, not anyone else. Just me. Ah... I've waited so long to say all that.",
        "That's a very good question... Where do I start? Remember when I teased that I'd fallen for you? The truth is... that wasn't entirely in jest. I fell for you some time ago. I fact, I'd very much like to spend my life with you. Of course, that's only if you'll have me...",
        "Oh my goodness!",
        "Yes! Let's! You've no idea what this means to me. This may be the happiest I've ever been! I'm so glad I could finally express my feelings. Now we can live the rest of our lives together! To think, I was able to choose this path of my own volition, and now I get to walk it with you! Should one person be allowed this much happiness? But still, you're only given one life. Are you sure you want to spend it with me? I may be quite demanding at times as I'm intend on pursuing my dreams. I want to help those in need, wherever they may be. And I won't give up on that.",
        "I thought that's what you might say! Perhaps that's why I fell for you. It's just the way you are. All right, let's be off! It's no short journey to Fhirdiad. Oh, something to note...",
        "'''You should know that I can be quite scatterbrained. And clumsy... But I will do everything in my power to help and support you too, whatever you may need! What a wonderful life we will lead together...'''",
        "Good evening, Professor. Returning from work, I take it?",
        "Try not to overtax yourself, all right? I'm concerned for your health. We wouldn't want you to wear yourself out. The goddess won't smite you if you rely on others for help, you know.",
        "Listen here, Professor. You might not like what I'm about to say. To be perfectly honest, I had my doubts when I first met you.",
        "I don't want me to think less of me for saying this, but here we are.",
        "At first, I thought you seemed too young to be a professor. It is unusual, you have to admit. Yet, you seemed very composed and mature, despite your age. You're strong-willed, encouraging, and you go to great lengths to ensure that everyone is cared for. But it almost feels like you're trying too hard to be a perfect role model for your students.",
        "If that's how you feel, I can't disagree. But I think it's necessary to give yourself a break every now and again. The mind has a tendency to make mistakes when you've exhausted yourself. In my case, I still seem to make mistakes even when I'm wide awake.",
        "Oh, you know. I'm always mixing up the dates for drills or misplacing things. Just the other day, I forgot to put on my uniform and headed out to practice wearing only my — Oh, um. Well, you can imagine how embarrassed I was. My mind can be so scattered sometimes. Anyway... where was I? Ah, that's right. What I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't push yourself too hard. If you do, you might end up in a pretty bad place.",
        "That reminds me! Is there anything I can do to assist you, Professor? If it's all right with you, I'd like to help in any way I can.",
        "I look forward to helping you out.",
        "Well, hello there, Professor. Is this a friend of yours?",
        "Is that so? I was sure you two knew each other. Is there something we can do for you, good sir?",
        "Really? What's troubling you?",
        "How terrible! That's no good at all. May I be of assistance? I'd be happy to lend a shoulder and escort you to the chapel.",
        "We'll need your help too, Professor. Here, sir, take my arm.",
        "Splendid work, Professor. He really seemed to appreciate our assistance.",
        "Putting a smile on someone's face always seems to brighten up the day. Is something wrong? You're giving me a strange look.",
        "Oh. Hmm... How should I put this... I suppose it's just second nature to me.",
        "It's difficult to describe, but I can usually tell when someone is worried about something. Back there, I could tell that both you and the old man were in distress. I spent a good amount of my life living in the church. Maybe that's why I'm so good at identifying these things?",
        "Did I not mention that before? I spent nearly 10 years of my life in the church of Faerghus. Many came to us with their troubles. In my own time of need, I once ran to the church myself, and they helped me. May I share something with you, Professor?",
        "I'd like to work in the church one day. I want to be like the priest who helped me. Never mind. It's not a very realistic dream. Please, forget I said anything. If I were someone else, perhaps a commoner without a Crest or stature, maybe things would be different. It's a bit sad, but... this is the way things have to be. After all, only the goddess can decide our fates.",
        "Do you have a moment, Professor? I need to speak with you.",
        "Thank you so much. This is what I wanted to address... This letter from my adoptive father just arrived.",
        "Oh! Have I not mentioned him? He's the reason I first came to the Officers Academy. He's also the one who dragged me from the church where I was living just so he could use my Crest.",
        "My Crest does not yet belong to a house, so he plans to use it as leverage to marry into the nobility. He's a very greedy man who was a roving merchant before adopting me, but now he's in the capital. This letter says that he's finally arranged to marry me off to a wealthy noble. I know he's just thinking of himself, but can't he see that this isn't a priority when we're at war?",
        "Ugh! I don't know what to do about this proposal!",
        "I can't see any way around it, so I fear that I must... I just don't want to let go of the life that I've made for myself. I know it's not what my heart wants, but I don't have the strength to say no.",
        "I believe I've mentioned this before, but I want to work in service of the church. Well, I suppose it doesn't necessarily have to be the church, but I want to help those in need. If I were to marry a noble, I think it would be difficult to realize that dream...",
        "It's just... I've always allowed myself to follow the whims of those above me. I convinced myself that everything in life was at the will of the goddess. I was blind to reality. I believed it was her will to both pull me from the church and guide me to the Officers Academy. The decision to enter this war was the first time I acted of my own free will. My adoptive father opposed this decision, but I somehow managed to convince him.",
        "Still, I couldn't free myself of him completely. This letter is proof of that. It's not that I'm scared of him, but there is something that worries me...",
        "Ah! I knew you'd understand, Professor. I've sat down to write a reply several times, but I can't muster up the courage, or the words. I was hoping you could provide me with the encouragement I need!",
        "OK! I think that may have been just the push I was looking for! I'll tell him the truth. That I've found a life worth pursuing and I must decline the proposal! Maybe I should tell him I've fallen for someone else?",
        "Why, it's you, Professor! Isn't that obvious?",
        "I'm just teasing! Now, I'm off to write this letter and stand my ground! Thank you for your encouragement!",
        "There you are! I apologize for the short notice, but I'm so glad you could make it! I'm sure you're very busy, being the hero of Fódlan and all.",
        "Do you mind hearing me out?",
        "Ah! Great! Here it is...",
        "I'm going to Fhirdiad to meet with my adoptive father, and I'd like you to accompany me.",
        "I've already decided exactly what I'm going to say. I'm choosing to live my life how I want, in pursuit of my own happiness. I need you to accept that. I'm in charge of my own destiny. Not you, not anyone else. Just me. Ah... I've waited so long to say all that.",
        "That's a very good question... Where do I start? Remember when I teased that I'd fallen for you? The truth is... that wasn't entirely in jest. I fell for you some time ago. I fact, I'd very much like to spend my life with you. Of course, that's only if you'll have me...",
        "Oh my goodness!",
        "Yes! Let's! You've no idea what this means to me. This may be the happiest I've ever been! I'm so glad I could finally express my feelings. Now we can live the rest of our lives together! To think, I was able to choose this path of my own volition, and now I get to walk it with you! Should one person be allowed this much happiness? But still, you're only given one life. Are you sure you want to spend it with me? I may be quite demanding at times as I'm intend on pursuing my dreams. I want to help those in need, wherever they may be. And I won't give up on that.",
        "I thought that's what you might say! Perhaps that's why I fell for you. It's just the way you are. All right, let's be off! It's no short journey to Fhirdiad. Oh, something to note...",
        "'''You should know that I can be quite scatterbrained. And clumsy... But I will do everything in my power to help and support you too, whatever you may need! What a wonderful life we will lead together...'''",
        "My goodness. Sword training again today? Don't overdo it, all right?",
        "A hobby? How wonderful! I would probably get tired of it, but that's just me.",
        "You're right! I completely forgot that's coming up! What should I do?",
        "Why didn't you say something sooner if you were so worried about me?",
        "You would do that for me? I'd really appreciate your help!",
        "I don't like to overdo it, but if we must. I'll try my best.",
        "I usually just hold the sword without thinking about my grip, you know? Let's see what happens now that you've shown me the proper way to handle it. I was nervous at first, but just look at me now! Hya! Ugh...",
        "I-I'm so sorry! I don't know what happened! I just meant to swing the sword. I didn't think it would go flying like that! I'm impressed with how quickly you can dodge!",
        "Maybe I'm not cut out for this whole sword fighting thing.",
        "Do you really think so? Thank you, Dimitri. It's very kind of you to— Oh! There's a rip in your cuff, Dimitri. How do you think—",
        "I'm the one who tore it, so I'll be the one who mends it. How does that sound? No, please don't worry yourself over it. Just focus on your exam.",
        "What can I do for you? Oh, is the cuff of your overcoat still torn? Mending that shouldn't be a problem at all.",
        "Goodness! You must have been concerned when I tore your cuff.",
        "Of course I'll teach you! Don't look so heartbroken.",
        "I'll go get my sewing kit. You wait here.",
        "I'm so sorry, Dimitri. I've never seen, um... Well, it's just a bit...",
        "I thought you might end up bending some needles if you tried mending this on your own, but... How did you manage to break a pair of scissors?",
        "There's no need to apologize! But you must have been uncomfortable making your way here with this tear.",
        "No giving up on yourself. You just have to practice, that's all. No matter how difficult something is, if you keep at it and don't give up, then you're sure to improve. Isn't that what you told me?",
        "Great! I'm glad to hear it! First things first, let's make sure the needle is actually threaded this time.",
        "Thank you! I have such a great time when you teach me that improving comes naturally!",
        "You shouldn't be so disappointed in yourself. You're improving too, you just need to keep at it.",
        "That's a big step! When we started, you couldn't even hold a pair of scissors without twisting them apart.",
        "You're no bother at all! I like sewing with you. It reminds me of when I was young and my mother taught me how to sew. My mother would sit with my brother and me and we'd all sew together. Ah, I really miss it. Even though I was barely better than you when I started. Did your mother like to sew, Dimitri?",
        "Oh, of course. I forgot that the queen of Faerghus passed away long ago.",
        "I'm sure she would have been happy to teach you if you had asked.",
        "I'm so sorry, Dimitri. I didn't mean to bring up such difficult memories.",
        "I see...",
        "More about me? Oh, goodness. I don't even know what to say.",
        "You want to know more about my family? On that topic, I'm happy to oblige. In fact, I'm so glad you asked.",
        "This might take a while, but would you be willing to stay and listen?",
        "Good evening, Dimitri. Have you come to pray?",
        "Oh yes, that's why I'm here. I love how calm and peaceful the cathedral is this late at night.",
        "Coming here on a quiet night always makes me think of those who aren't with us anymore. We've lost so many in this war. Too many to count. I hope they all get to live in eternal happiness at the goddess's side... These prayers are all I have to offer.",
        "I think you're kind too, Dimitri. Sometimes to a fault.",
        "But why do you kill? For the sake of your loved ones? Those who have passed? Real monsters kill for selfish reasons. They're incapable of expressing sorrow when they kill. So please...don't call yourself a monster.",
        "It's sad, but the truth is that people forget. You may be afraid to forget your past, but you'll never be able to revisit it. Living in the present is the best we can do. We owe it to those who can't come back.",
        "What do you want to do now, Dimitri? Continue fighting for those who have died? Not as a king, but as my classmate. What do you want to do?",
        "I want to keep sewing and training with you, even after you've become king. I want to be your friend.",
        "Please, I can't hear any more of this self-deprecation! I just want to be by your side. Is that so much to ask?",
        "I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels that way. Let's spend a little more time here together. Just the two of us.",
        "Hello, Ferdinand. Did you come to pray?",
        "Uhh... I guess so.",
        "Absolutely. I know exactly what you mean. I couldn't agree more.",
        "Ah, well, I don't really know that I count as a noble anyway.",
        "Umm...yes. You're right. I usually am.",
        "Yes, I definitely agree. Definitely...agree.",
        "Um, it was great talking to you, but I'm getting pretty sleepy. I'm going to head off to bed. Good night!",
        "Huh? What's going on here? Hey! Stop that! Can't you see he's not interested?",
        "Oh! I just thought it looked a little... Actually, now I'm curious. What kind of business are you conducting? I've been told I have a keen eye for appraisal.",
        "Any price? You must be able to afford anything your heart desires! But did you consider that he might have a good reason to not sell it? Maybe it's a family heirloom. Or simply his favorite sword.",
        "Oh. Hello, Ferdinand. Do you have an opinion on all this?",
        "Hurt? No, I'm fine. We were only talking.",
        "What? Oh, you're talking about that time in town. I wouldn't say I did anything brave, really. I just asked what was going on.",
        "I...I don't think what I did was quite the same thing.",
        "The point I was trying to make is that some things in this world can't be bought or sold with money. I think I let myself get a little too worked up though. It's just... when I saw it happening, it reminded me of my own past...",
        "Life was becoming... difficult for us, so my mother and I fled from House Bartels. We found refuge in a small church in Faerghus and lived there for a few years. A man appeared one day and said that he wanted to adopt me. It was obvious he only cared about my bloodline and Crest. The priest refused to let me go, but the man used his money to overwhelm the church. In the end, I had no choice but to leave with him. That solider we saw... I guess he just reminded me of my adopted father.",
        "Hehe.",
        "I never though I'd hear you question the value of nobility, Ferdinand.",
        "I completely agree.",
        "Ah! Ferdinand! Why are you so short of breath?",
        "What's this... Um... Oh!",
        "Where did you come across these?",
        "That's amazing! I mean... amazingly irresponsible! I can't believe you put yourself at risk for my benefit. I really wish you wouldn't do such things!",
        "Do you really believe these will set me free?",
        "That does sound nice...but... I'm sorry, Ferdinand, but I think you should hold on to the documents.",
        "I've lived so much of my life following everyone else's lead... So much so that I've come to terms with it. It's almost unavoidable at this point. But with these...I could regain my freedom and change all that.",
        "Of course I do. Let me try that again in a way you might understand. Ahem. A true noble cuts their own path, seizing freedom from the clutches of tyranny!",
        "But I am really very happy that you're so concerned with my well-being, Ferdinand. It means so much to me that you went through all that trouble on my behalf.",
        "Dear Goddess. Please protect us...",
        "Oh, Dedue. Was there something you needed?",
        "I see. I'll be with you in just a moment. I'm almost finished here.",
        "I was. Praying for everyone's safety. And praying for good desserts tonight. And that my next exam goes well",
        "It's true. I've thought the same thing myself. That reminds me, Dedue. Weren't you born in Duscur?",
        "Do the people of Duscur pray to the goddess too?",
        "Oh?",
        "So your people prayed to different gods depending on what they needed?",
        "Your beliefs sound so different from ours! Tell me more.",
        "Duscur may be gone. but you're still here. Would you tell me more about it the next time we meet?",
        "Really? That would be great! I'm looking forward to hearing more soon.",
        "Ah, I think I get it. So, the sky god got into an argument with the earth god, then Duscur was created?",
        "There's something so mysterious about it. There are only mountains separating us from Duscur, but it's like a completely different world. This has been so interesting. I've never learned so much about it before!",
        "Really? That's a shame. It's almost like when someone dies, or a family line ends. I think a place is only truly destroyed when there's no one left to remember it. You should tell more people about Duscur to keep it alive.",
        "Oh? Why do you think that?",
        "I'm different though. I don't know anyone who was killed by the people of Duscur. I don't hold a grudge against you and I never have.",
        "Um, Dedue? Is this recipe from Duscur?",
        "No, no! I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Would you teach me how to make it soon?",
        "You're right. I'm so sorry. Ah! I have an idea! My mother taught me to bake the perfect sweets to go with tea. Would you like to learn how to bake them? It's a secret Martritz family recipe that's been passed down for generations!",
        "It's true. My father's family was wiped out in the Empire. I'm the last living descendant.",
        "Of course! Now that my family's gone, I'm the only one who knows the secret! The sweets would vanish from Fódlan if something happened to me.",
        "Oh, Dedue! Are you praying to the goddess of Fódlan? That seems odd. Won't the Duscur gods be upset if they hear you praying to another land's deity?",
        "Huh. So, the goddess is part of a pantheon... I guess that's one way to interpret it. Anyway, what are you praying for?",
        "That's a lovely prayer. I was just thinking about praying for that myself.",
        "Hey, Dedue? What are your plans for yourself once this war is finally over?",
        "I thought you might say that.",
        "That's a good question. I was thinking about traveling to Duscur.",
        "Isn't it where you were born? And isn't it where your wonderful food and stories come from? I think those are reasons enough to visit at least once!",
        "You really think so? Then I hope the war ends as soon as possible!",
        "We're going to have to shower the goddess with prayers. We'll pray that she watches over and protects us while we work to end this war. Then, when it's finally finished, we can travel!",
        "Yes! That's a brilliant idea! Which of the Duscur gods should we pray to?",
        "Or?",
        "Come on! What were you going to say?",
        "Oh! I know! It's the god of travel, right?",
        "I knew I was right! You taught me so much about your gods! So let's pray. For the end of the war and for our safe travels to Duscur.",
        "Here you go, Felix. Have some tea.",
        "Sorry, but we're all out of cakes. Should I make some more?",
        "Oh, your clothes are so dirty! Let me wash them for you.",
        "There's nothing wrong with me. I'm just making tea. Is there something wrong with that?",
        "I...I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. You just remind me so much of my little brother...",
        "Yes. His name was Emile. We have different fathers, but we grew up in the same household. That is, until I was about eight or nine years old. I haven't seen him since then...",
        "Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying you remind me of the Death Knight or Jeritza. Just...Emile.",
        "Oh! I'm so sorry. I'll leave you alone. Please, help yourself to more tea if you'd like. I can leave the pot. Good-bye.",
        "Oh! Were you looking for me, Felix?",
        "I'm fine now. Thank you for your concern.",
        "I'm so sorry. I didn't want to get in your way out there... I just couldn't help but worry! I was only trying to keep an eye on you...",
        "Yes, of course. You're right. I have no excuses.",
        "Are you sure? I'd hate to get in your way again.",
        "Hmm?",
        "But I thought you didn't like that. Didn't you say you were fed up with it?",
        "Oh... I didn't know you had a brother too...",
        "Well, you don't look like him, but something about you feels so familiar. It just makes me want to protect you. That's not to say that you're incapable or unreliable or anything like that... In fact, it's quite the opposite. You're the one who just came to check on me.",
        "Yes, I'll try to be more careful. Thank you for being so kind, Felix.",
        "Oh no, I don't need anything. I was just hoping to talk to you, Felix.",
        "You know, I'm not just using you as a stand-in for my brother. I don't mean to upset you... But i've come to realize that you two don't have that much in common after all.",
        "It's not that I want to be near Emile, but I want to be near you.",
        "How embarrassing! It must sound like I'm coming on to you! Regardless, you've made it clear that you don't want me around.",
        "Good! Then I'll continue to spend time at your side!",
        "What's that? Did you say something? Never mind that. Why don't we go out for a nice cup of tea?",
        "Oh no! This isn't right! Now what am I supposed to do?",
        "I accidentally made this food much sweeter than I wanted...",
        "Huh? This is delicious! You're an amazing cook, Ashe!",
        "Wow, that's a lot of responsibility to take on at an early age. No wonder you always work so hard. I might learn something if I watch you cook!",
        "It's true that I'm quite good at baking, but I'm not the best when it comes to seasoning. Maybe it's because I don't like spicy food? It's tough to make food taste good when you don't enjoy it. I just had an idea! If the reason I can't cook spicy food is because I don't like it... Then all I have to do is eat some spicy food! If I learn to like it, then I'll be better at making it, right?",
        "Np, no, no. None of that matters. Once I've made a decision, I have to go with it! I'll make something spicy right away!",
        "'''' Hey, Ashe! Which seasonings should I use? These ones?",
        "Whoa! What happened? The pan's smoking!",
        "Oh! Ashe! I'm so glad you're here! My cooking's not going very well at all...",
        "I used some of this spice, that seasoning, and the herbs on the top shelf. Then I started frying it in oil.",
        "Oh no! The people in the dining hall don't look so good...",
        "I'm so sorry. I always mess everything up.",
        "I just need to figure out how to do it right for next time.",
        "Of course! If I didn't, that would just be a waste of everything you taught me.",
        "If you quit every time you made a mistake, then you'd never learn anything, right?",
        "Ah! Maybe my mistake was frying the herb in oil. If I had boiled it instead, then there wouldn't be smoke. What do you think, Ashe?",
        "Great! I'm gonna get this right next time for sure!",
        "Excuse me, Ashe. Do you have a moment? I've finally managed to finish cooking a dish and I would love for you to have a taste!",
        "I used that herb you suggested. Boiling it gave off such a lovely aroma. I think I used the right amount of spice too. Even I could eat it without burning my tongue! I'm a much better cook now, thanks to you. I hope you can continue teaching me...",
        "Thank me? Even after all the trouble I've caused you?",
        "Oh! Someone you cared about? Romantically? This is all so sudden, Ashe. I-I don't—",
        "What a relief! I didn't even know you had a brother!",
        "He sounds like a wonderful person.",
        "I've done nothing but bother you with frivolous little things. I'm sure I could never be like your brother... But I'd like to stay by your side... If you'll have me...",
        "I want to be there to help you in times of need, or to cheer you up when you're feeling down. I should be able to manage that without doing too much damage!",
        "Oh, hello, Sylvain. I was just on my way to pray. How did you guess?",
        "Oh, I get it. You're the type who's always looking at girls, aren't you?",
        "Oh, really? You think I'm so clumsy that I need someone to watch over me? Is that why you can't take your eyes off me?",
        "I don't know where to begin.",
        "I like to pray. I've been praying regularly since I was a child.",
        "That's right. I was raised in House Bartels.",
        "It's a complicated story. I'm not sure that it's a very interesting one, but I'm happy to share it with you.",
        "Oh, no. I don't mind. I wasn't trying to hide anything from you. House Martritz fell shortly before I was born.",
        "My father passed away while my mother was still pregnant with me, so she had nowhere to go. After I was born, my mother ended up marrying the head of House Bartels. Shortly after, my mother bore a true Bartels child who bore a Crest. She and I were treated as though we were no longer useful to the family after that.",
        "They must have been. My mother and I were removed from the family and forced to flee to a church in the Kingdom. I abandoned the Bartels name and took up our old family name again.",
        "Yes, I-oh! Praying! I forgot that I was on my way to pray!",
        "Yes, see you!",
        "Hello, Sylvain. What a treat to see you here. I thought you preferred places with more ladies around.",
        "Oh, come now. I'm sure you use that line all the time.",
        "Well, if you were really interested in me, I would want you to get to know me better.",
        "You act like you're full of regret, but I know you don't really mean it. Still, I'm glad to hear you say that, at least. I told you such a boring story the last time we spoke... I was worried you might think I was a dull person.",
        "Right. We can't choose our bloodline. You've got a Crest too, haven't you, Sylvain? What has your experience been like?",
        "Please don't feel the need to hold back on my account. I'm here if you need someone to share in your pain.",
        "This has nothing to do with your Crest or family. I'm just asking as your friend. How should I put this? When I look at you, I don't see a Crest. I want to see the real you.",
        "I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to dredge up such awful things.",
        "Don't say that. I'm glad we were able to talk. I feel like I'm finally seeing the real you. Oh, Sylvain. Will you save me from the curse of having a Crest.",
        "Sure, sure.",
        "Good evening, Sylvain! Thank you for coming out to see me.",
        "Hmm? I don't know what speed has to do with it, but there was something I wanted to talk to you about.",
        "I can be so forgetful at times. I neglected to mention this the other day. I meant to say... that I know you've been through a lot in life.",
        "Your parents have placed a great deal of pressure on you as their heir... And it's all because you were born with a Crest. You've had to put up with such lofty expectations.",
        "But didn't you mention that your brother envied you enough to wish you dead? I'm sure that wasn't easy.",
        "Didn't you also mention that women were only interested in having your, as you say, \"Crest baby\"? I'm not very interested in the particulars, but... I get the feeling that you don't care very much for these women who throw themselves at you.",
        "Your secret's safe with me. I understand the pain you've had to carry.",
        "That's why you feel comfortable letting your guard down around me. Come now, that's enough with the sad smile.",
        "Not at all. You actually look more handsome to me with honesty on your face.",
        "Don't be ashamed of crying. I'm here to protect you. Will you protect me in return?",
        "It truly did. You bought just about everything in the place.",
        "Oh, really? The number of bags you're carrying says otherwise.",
        "It was fun! It's nice going into town without having to run errands for once.",
        "Me too. It almost feels like that time in our lives was a story from long ago.",
        "Me and you, right? We're the same old friends we always were.",
        "I've known you so long I can always guess.",
        "Is something wrong? You sound worried.",
        "I wonder that too. I don't think everything in the future will be perfect. But it's us, so I'm sure—",
        "How did you know what I was going to say?",
        "Oh. It's getting late. We'd better hurry back before the professor gets angry.",
        "What? Wait for me, Annie! You know I'm not as fast as you!",
        "You're so good at sticking to a plan. I should leave the shopping to you. I'll stay out of your way and just browse.",
        "Uh, Annie? Is this a friend of yours?",
        "Oh! The knights are coming!",
        "Annie, run!",
        "I hope so...but what were you thinking? That sort of behavior isn't like you at all!",
        "You're actually blaming me for this? It's like I don't even know you anymore!",
        "Annie...do you have a moment?",
        "Not so fast! I haven't properly apologized yet! So, I'm sorry. I just... I got scared. Imagine if something had happened to you because of me...",
        "You would have just run away if you were on your own, wouldn't you? Instead you acted defensively because I was there. I dragged you down...",
        "Annie...",
        "Thank you for saying that... And again, I'm sorry. You're just so important to me. I know I could never find another friend like you. You've stayed by my side through thick and thin... I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if anything happened to you because of me.",
        "Of course, Annie. Friends forever.",
        "I'm sorry. I should have said something sooner.",
        "That's just like you. Come, let's go for tea.",
        "You do? Oh, Annie, you're too sweet.",
        "Well, I'm always happy to bake for you, Annie!",
        "Good work with your training today, Ingrid. Here's something to wipe up the sweat.",
        "You're very welcome! I've been here since you started.",
        "I disagree. I just couldn't help but admire your training technique. I have to say, you were very impressive. I'm nowhere near as graceful as you.",
        "Goodness! Me? How so?",
        "That perfume is a favorite of mine. I'm so glad you like it.",
        "I'll gladly share some with you. You're welcome to come visit my room whenever you'd like. We can have tea and chat! How does that sound?",
        "From now on, we'll meet up whenever we have time. We can go right now if you're free?",
        "It's no trouble at all! You'll never know if you're the type who enjoys chatting over tea if you never try.",
        "There's no need to apologize at all! Please, have a seat.",
        "We've met for tea so many times, but you never seem to get used to it, do you, Ingrid?",
        "I actually wanted to gripe about something that's been bothering me.",
        "Thank you. The one thing I really wanted to talk about is marriage...",
        "Yes. I received a letter from my adoptive father about marriage discussions with a noble family.",
        "That's the problem. No matter what I decide, I'll probably be married off anyway. What I really want to do is help those in need. But I think it would be more difficult to do so if I married a nobleman.",
        "Sorry? To...silence him?",
        "'' ''We don't need to go that far. I'm sorry, I really just needed to let that out. I don't need you to worry about solving my problems.",
        "That must have been difficult for you. Would you have married him if he had survived?",
        "I see. A very noble cause indeed. How strange that we should be worrying about the same thing.",
        "It's true. Enjoying a nice chat over tea with you like this makes me realize... Maybe the paths we walk aren't so different after all. Don't you think?",
        "That they are, Ingrid... I would love to get to know you better, if that's OK. I want to know about your childhood, your favorite books, the sweets you like, anything at all!",
        "Yeee-ow!",
        "Yes, I'm fi—Ow! I'm fine! I just twisted my ankle.",
        "Are you sure it's OK to be seen helping me?",
        "I thought you only extended your kindness to the nobility.",
        "In that case, I'll gladly accept your offer.",
        "Thank you so much for escorting me.",
        "If you're still offering to help, then I can't say no!",
        "Thank you again, Lorenz. You know, I think I've learned something about you.",
        "In truth, it's not that you only extend your kindness to noble women...It's that you can't even see us of lower birth.",
        "You and I have been together all this time, but never once did you look me in the eye.",
        "Forget about him? What could that possibly mean?",
        "I appreciate your concern, but I can take care of myself. Everything is about nobility and commonfolk with you, Lorenz. It's tiresome.",
        "Is that to say you would have left me lying on the floor in pain had it not been your duty to assist?",
        "Excuse me? Are you implying that you would have taken advantage of me if you were lowborn?",
        "Oh, Lorenz. You'll never change.",
        "I find myself growing irritated just looking at you.",
        "You claim that you don't want to be involved with common women, don't you? But I know, deep in your heart you love being around us. You're willfully ignorant to that. I hope you know what you're depriving yourself of.",
        "Fruitless?! Ugh! How can you say such things? What would happen if you fell in love with a commoner?",
        "So, your duty as a noble is more important that your own feelings?",
        "If that's true, then your whole existence is rather sad.",
        "I think I've heard enough. I have to go.",
        "It is.",
        "Again, it is.",
        "I didn't mean to hide it from you, but you never asked. Besides, I am considered common now. I don't care to flaunt my noble past or my Crest. I have no desire to return to that status.",
        "Not at all. That's a separate matter entirely. Even if I were to fall in love, regardless of their social status... I'm not looking to marry right now.",
        "You mean in terms of love and marriage?",
        "But if you marry a woman who isn't a noble, then haven't you neglected your duty?",
        "Well, now that doesn't sound flexible at all! How can you know if someone will benefit your family? Would you investigate her before allowing yourself feelings? That doesn't sound very noble of you...",
        "I'm sorry, Lorenz. I was only teasing. I'm sure your lack of tact is what women find so irresistible.",
        "Oh, nothing at all. I hope you do your family proud and fulfill your duty.",
        "Oh my, Ignatz. You're in a hurry. Is something the matter?",
        "Of course I did! I'll head over in a bit.",
        "We're not needed until after the lunch hour. We have plenty of time.",
        "Well, rushing around doesn't help, does it? I mostly try to stay out of everyone's way. There's no point in overexerting yourself. Anything that needs doing will get done eventually.",
        "I suppose, but it's not nearly as philosophical as you make it sound.",
        "Honestly, Ignatz, you're making this out to be much bigger than it is. I mostly just don't pay attention. Being like me is more trouble than it's worth.",
        "There's no need to apologize. Come on, let's head to the training grounds. I may slow you down though.",
        "Goodness! Don't strain yourself!",
        "Oh, Ignatz. What are you sighing over?",
        "There's nothing wrong with it. I sigh here all the time. The goddess receives all our prayers and our sighs. What's bothering you? I'd be happy to talk about it, if you'd like.",
        "Is that so? Am I not worth talking to?",
        "I don't find you pathetic at all. Is there something you would rather pursue?",
        "You want to become an artist? How wonderful!",
        "Me? I simply want to help people with their troubles. Those who can't help themselves. I've considered working for the church, but that's only a vague idea... I haven't spent much time considering how I would go about that though... Oh, I'm sorry. We were supposed to be discussing your troubles.",
        "Everyone in this world feels a little lost, you know. I really do believe that the life of an artist is a wonderful dream to pursue.",
        "You should! I'm sure your painting will help someone else in their time of need.",
        "Are you praying, Ignatz? Are you concerned about something?",
        "It takes courage to stray from the path that has been set out before you. It's never easy. I'm in a similar position. I have been carrying out my adoptive father's wishes up until this point. But...",
        "How could anyone find happiness in that? Even with your father's demands, you can still work toward one small dream at a time.",
        "Oh, goodness. That's not how most people would describe me. I just don't want you to give up on your art. Besides, I genuinely do want to see your painting of the goddess.",
        "My future has been decided for me as well. I'm to be married off to a nobleman.",
        "Is it really that surprising? I think many young women face the same fate.",
        "Hmm... I suppose I haven't given it much thought. Whatever may happen, I'm sure everything will work out in the end if I don't give up on my dreams.",
        "What's wrong, Ignatz? You have a strange look on your face.",
        "Quick! Paint before you lose it!",
        "I'd be happy to help, but I'm not sure what I can do.",
        "Well! To say such a thing directly before the altar! That must be some kind of sin... I'll say an extra prayer for him.",
        "Goodness, Hilda. You look worried. Is something the matter?",
        "It must be urgent to call you at this hour of the morning! Go see what the professor needs from you. I can take care of the flowers.",
        "It's no problem at all! Let me take the water from you.",
        "Right! I'm off!",
        "And that's the last of that! Perfect!",
        "Oh, Hilda! Is your meeting with the professor over already?",
        "Lunchtime? I hadn't realized how late it was... After watering the flowers, I noticed that the greenhouse was in need of some tidying. I must have gotten a bit carried away. It's so pleasant working in here!",
        "No, no. It was my pleasure. Anyway, shall we head to the dining hall?",
        "'''' What was that, Hilda? Come along, I'm hungry!",
        "Good morning, Hilda. Is anything troubling you today?",
        "I'm sorry to hear that. Have I done something to upset you?",
        "Goodness! It was never my intention to have you worry about me!",
        "Of course. What is it?",
        "Following my morning prayers, I'll be cleaning the altar then caring for the flowers in the greenhouse. Then it's off to the library to help organize and sort, then to the dining hall to wipe down the tables and chairs. The floors could use a good polish too... Oh! And the weather's so nice that I might air out the bedding! After that it's—",
        "Well, the dishcloths in the dining hall are all frayed, so I was hoping to mend them.",
        "Whatever do you mean? And why are you speaking so loudly all of a sudden?",
        "You want to help? That would be delightful!",
        "I suppose. I believe it's important to help where you can. If you see someone in trouble, you can't leave them, can you?",
        "I'm sure you can. You and I are very similar in that way.",
        "That may be so, but you thought I was in trouble and you agreed to help, didn't you?",
        "That's exactly what I do! I'm so happy to have found a kindred spirit!",
        "Now that I've got you at my side, I can take on even more responsibilities!",
        "Oh, Alois! What could you possibly need at this hour?",
        "I suppose I am.",
        "Goodness, you want me to share one? Well, certainly! I'm rarely asked to tell ghost stories. Which one should I tell? Perhaps the one I heard in the monastery the other day?",
        "Is something the matter?",
        "Are you sure? It's no trouble right now.",
        "I see. That's a shame, but I suppose it can't be helped. If you don't mind my asking, why the sudden interest in hearing a ghost story?",
        "Hmm... A knight who's afraid of ghosts.",
        "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to laugh. Even knights can't be stoic toward everything. I'm impressed that you're working so hard to face your fear.",
        "I will tell you my scariest ghost story the next chance I get!",
        "The time has come. I have been waiting to curse your soul with this tale of ghostly terror.",
        "Then we shall proceed. Our story begins when a friend of mine visited a graveyard in eastern Faerghus—",
        "Whatever is the matter, Alois? I've barely just begun.",
        "Very well then. Now where was I? Ah, yes. My friend went to visit his grandfather's grave, staying the night at a neighboring church.",
        "As darkness crept, he awoke to a strange sound. He peered out into the black of night to see a misshapen figure desecrating the graves.",
        "He barricaded himself in his room, waiting for the first glimmer of sunlight before fleeing the church. My friend soon learned that the graveyard was built on the ruins of an ancient battlefield. Legend says that the souls of the knights who fell during the battle roam freely after dark. He was sure that the misshapen figure he saw was the ghost of a warrior, searching for its earthly remains. After his stay at the church, my friend complained of restless nights and an unbearable weight on his chest. His closest friends and family feared a change in his eyes, as though it wasn't him occupying his body. No one knows for certain what happened that night. After years of isolation. his body was found... in the very graveyard where it all began! Alois? Did you hear me? I said \"in the very graveyard where it all began!\"",
        "I don't think many battles take place in graveyards in the middle of the night. But I suppose it's important to be prepared, isn't it?",
        "Of course! I'm happy to share another spooky story next time!",
        "Yes, that's all there is. You listened all the way to the end!",
        "There's no need to thank me. You're the one who did all the hard work. You should be proud of yourself! Now you can face any challenge on the battlefield without fear! I had always planned on working in the monastery once the war was over... But seeing knights like you makes me consider joining up.",
        "Helping those in need with the goddess always at my side? I can't think of a better way to live.",
        "I'm well aware of the nature of a knight's duty. But I no longer have anything to fear. I've been on the battlefield. I've killed my enemies many times.",
        "My mother would respect my wishes, but my adoptive father would need to be persuaded...",
        "Thank you, Alois. And you should know, I intend to improve my ghost storytelling as well.",
        "If I want to continue helping you, I'll have to seek out much scarier stories to share.",
        "Nonsense! It's no trouble at all! Besides, we have to help each other the best we can.",
        "What's this? Well, if it isn't Cyril! How did he manage to fall asleep here? The warmth must have put him right down. He looks so cute when he's napping.",
        "I'll just keep reading. No need to disturb him...",
        "Good morning, Cyril. Did you sleep well?",
        "** '''''': It's Mercedes. I hope you'll commit my name to memory.",
        "You're from Almyra, aren't you? I hope you haven't been uncomfortable here at the academy.",
        "Were you not eating before you came here?",
        "Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Are you hungry?",
        "You should eat up. To make up for all the meals you missed in the past!",
        "Just call me Mercie. That's what my friends call me.",
        "It doesn't seem like he has very many friends here... It's troubling, but I probably shouldn't pry.",
        "Did Cyril fall asleep here again? Hmm. There's nothing to cover him with. He'll catch cold if he's here too long. Oh well, I guess I have no other options. I'll have to take care of this myself.",
        "I'm keeping you warm so you don't catch cold. Um, I'm sorry. Did I make you uncomfortable?",
        "Oh! I'm happy to hear you call me that! You know, I seem to find you in here pretty often. Do you have a favorite book?",
        "I see. You always seem so wrapped up in your work. That is, whenever you're not sleeping in the library. Do you have many friends here?",
        "But don't you want some? Having friends is much more fun than spending all of your time alone.",
        "An outsider? You? Who would possibly say—",
        "Oh, no. You really don't have to. I didn't mean to bring up such difficult memories. But you know... Everyone here sees you as a friend. Even me. I see you as a good friend.",
        "Different? In what way? Do you not like me?",
        "Really? That's just as well! You remind me of my little brother!",
        "I do, but I haven't seen him in so long. It's almost like he's not really my brother anymore... But you can count on me if you need anything at all. I'll do my best to help you out.",
        "I never imagined I'd see you again.",
        "Emile, I've missed you so much. How long has it been since we last spoke?",
        "And just look at you now! All grown up. I notice that you still indulge in sweets. It makes me happy to see that you're still the same in some ways.",
        "Well, of course. That's because this is a recipe only mother and I know of. ... Oh no! You've gotten crumbs all over your face! Sit still while I wipe them off.",
        "Oh, come on. Allow me to be your big sis. It won't hurt you to indulge me.",
        "It doesn't matter to me how you've changed. You will always be my baby brother. You are precious to both me and to Mother.",
        "She is very well! You should send her a letter. She'd be so thrilled.",
        "Mother has always borne a deep regret over what happened. We should have brought you with us... We never intended to leave you with House Bartels.",
        "Yes... That's what Mother said, too. He'd have done exactly that. You know, I've heard about what happened... About killing the family of House Bartels.",
        "Neither of those. That isn't why I brought this up. I understand your reasons, but it's a terrible thing to take a life. You understood that even then. I've been waiting a very long time to ask you. Why did you do it? Why did you kill your father?",
        "I know you're avoiding my question. I can hear it in your voice. I won't ask any further if you don't want to tell me why. But... just let me know if you ever feel ready to talk about it.",
        "Until then, I'll wait patiently.",
        "Hello, Emile. The war council is about to begin — come on!",
        "What's the matter? You're so pale... Have you been injured?",
        "Emile?",
        "Ah!",
        "What?",
        "Emile? Wait... You... You're not Emile. You're the Death Knight. You may look like him, but you are not him. He would never say such a thing.",
        "I see. So you want to kill me? Then do as you must. You are within your rights.",
        "Mother and I must be the reason the Death Knight exists within you. A young boy left all alone in House Bartels without us? I can't imagine how lonely and terrible that must have been. To our half-siblings who bore no Crests, we were nothing more than... intruders. Their horrible words and violent actions were only bearable because the three of us supported one another through it. All alone in a place like that... It's little wonder that you broke down as you have. We should have rescued you. We should have offered ourselves to save you.",
        "However, we cannot turn back the hands of time. Atonement is all I have for you now.",
        "Emile?",
        "Wh-what? But why did you do such a thing?",
        "Emile...",
        "Because there are two sides to you, you fear that I endanger myself?",
        "Just what are you implying, Emile?",
        "You can't leave... But if it must be so, then answer me this before you depart. Why did you kill your father?",
        "You... You did it for me. To protect me...",
        "Hold on! That isn't fair!",
        "No! You can't just tell me all of that and then vanish forever! Please stay. At least until this horrible war meets its end. I want you around just a while longer...",
        "Even if I am hurt — or worse yet, killed — if it is by your hand, I will find peace. I am and will always be your big sister, Emile.",
        "I love you, Emile. That never changes. Understand?"

        "Is that really what you are thinking? Or maybe you have curiosity about the mark on my face?",
        "You are already knowing that I am from Brigid. This is a mark from Brigid. It is a prayer to the forest spirits. A prayer to be protected. Hunters ask the forest spirits to have safe and bountiful hunting. There are many spirits in Brigid. I have more marks on my arms and back. They are prayers for my family's health and triumph.  Are you wanting to see them?",
        "I have much gratitude for you, Professor. You always listen with patience. I can read and understand the language of Fódlan, but speak it... gives me difficulty. I hope I will keep having your support. And I will give you my support too, with my whole heart. I have things that I cannot fail to accomplish.",
        "Hiya! Hm? Professor?",
        "Please take my apologies. I lost time while I was training. There are not many chances for real fighting here. My body is more weak than it was. Weaker, I mean. I will keep training now. I hope your night is good!",
        "I need to have more training. There are things that I have not done yet. Things that have to be done. For the future, I have to try with hardness. Training, studying, socializing... I will not always be having time to do those things. And speaking the language of Fódlan... I worry I will never be doing it just right.",
        "Why? Because... the position of Brigid is weak. Fódlan and Dagda are big. Brigid is a small island in the middle of them. Brigid has great beauty... but little power. We will not have... will not survive, unless we get more strength. I will lead Brigid, and so I have responsibility. I have to have more strength than anyone.",
        "I am an ally of everyone, and I have belonging at the Officers Academy. That is also why I try with hardness. You can always be counting me. I mean... counting on me. But you should know that one of these days will be when I return to Brigid. Before that day, do not try stopping me from trying. And please, keep watch... watching over me. With you, I can try with more hardness than I could alone.",
        "Professor... Please do not be concerned. I just did too much overworking and lost my strength.",
        "I have sorrow... I mean, I am sorry to be fainting at a time like this. Even though I was not asking for your care and attention, you gave it willingly...",
        "Will you have a listen to me? There is something that I must be saying. I am thinking you already have knowledge of why I came to Fódlan... Not for studying but as a hostage for the Empire, so that Brigid would not be rebelling anymore. It feels like...a knife against my throat. That I am making my grandfather obey the Empire.",
        "** ''Black Eagles route'': Because I am a hostage, it is not an option to be giving up. I must be fighting and winning and staying alive. I must do anything to be making life better for Brigid. To be making Brigid and the Empire stand as equals.",
        "That is what my people are wanting from me...and what my grandfather, the king of Brigid, is wanting!",
        "I have understanding. Wait... No, I...I actually do not have understanding. Yet. What I am understanding is that there is something I am not understanding. When I know what my true want is, I give you my promise that I will be telling you first.",
        "We really had success! We got the victory! The war is finished now! But...there are still many, many problems for solving. I... It is past the time I should be returning to Brigid.",
        "Yes. My grandfather... I...I can't be leaving him now. Our relationship with Fódlan will be changing. I am royalty of Brigid. There are duties that I must be fulfilling. But...I can't be sitting on the throne. I will be choosing a new leader, and then I will be returning to Fódlan. This is what my heart is wanting.",
        "And that is... I will be telling you now if you are wanting to hear it... I am wanting to...to stay with you. I have hopes that we can spend all of our lives close to each other. I want us to be supporting each other and live with each other...in times of joy and times of sorrow. In all of the times. Is that... Is that a possibility?",
        "This is...a ring of promise. I have understanding! And I am accepting with all of my heart! Rings are for promising weddings! I read all about that custom from a Fódlan book! I have never told my feelings to someone like that before. I had so much nervousness! You have made my heart fly with happiness... I, Petra, give you my promise! Spirits of Earth, please be guiding us home for all of our days. Spirits of Water, please be filling our cups with kindness and good fortune. Spirits of Wind, please be gifting us freedom and divine protection. Those are the words we are saying in Brigid when we give someone our promise.",
        "There is one other thing to be said...",
        "'''My beloved... You are the most precious thing in the world to me. You enchant and fascinate me, and each day, you set my heart aflame.'''",
        "'''Did I give you a surprise? I have been practicing those words with great diligence. I am...so happy, You have my deep gratitude... and all of my heart. For now and forever.'''",
        "Professor. I am not understanding where the meaning is here... When and how is this expression used... \"I fell for it.\"",
        "The expression is, \"I fell for it!\"",
        "Can I ask you about another word? The one that is written here... Hm? Is something on my face?",
        "Is that really what you are thinking? Or maybe you have curiosity about the mark on my face?",

Not for studying, but as a hostage for the empire, so that Brigid would not be rebelling anymore. It feels like... a knife against my throat. That I am making my grandfather obey the Empire. If I were running away from the Empire, then Brigid would be defeated. I am not having any options. To be living, I must be fighting to win... For Brigid to be living, the Empire needs to be crushed. So I must be crushing the Empire. That is what my people are wanting from me... and what my grandfather, the king of Brigid, is wanting!",
        "I have understanding. Wait... No, I... I actually do not have understanding. Yet. What I am understanding is that there is something I am not understanding. Before the war is over, I will have understanding... That you can be counting on!",
        "Lady Edelgard. Everything is well with me. Thank you for your question. Everyone shows great kindness, even while I am still learning about the language.",
        "If that is your want. I will rely on you if I have the need. However, I will not have that need. I can resolve any problems that occur by myself.",
        "Do not spend your worry on me. In Brigid, there is a phrase we say. You cannot shoot two birds with one arrow. Brigid and I are that second bird. Your first target is...your ambition. Can you disagree?",
        "Huh?",
        "I will take your words to my heart. And you will be seeing my power. I give you my promise.",
        "I have been watching you in secrecy, Edelgard. But you and Hubert were noticing me, correct?",
        "You have my thanks. I have been making a decision that I am wanting to learn from you. I was thinking it was enough to be shooting one bird with one arrow. But after speaking with you, I trained with hardness. Now I can be shooting two birds with one arrow.",
        "Yes. A single arrow.",
        "I am having a joke.",
        "I really was shooting these birds with one arrow, but my joke is that I did have understanding about what you told me. I took it to my heart.",
        "You are a person with great bluntness. I am admiring of you. As an emperor, a commander, a warrior, and a friend... You are excelling at all that you do. All of the Empire is resting on...on your shoulders. And that is including Brigid too. I will not be falling behind you. I will be carrying Brigid on my shoulders too. And one day, you and I will be facing each other, and we will be shaking hands.",
        "Your words give me great joy. And it also gave me joy to see you being flustered when I was showing you the birds!",
        "We both are growing every day. I hope we will keep doing so!",
        "Claude?",
        "Why are you taking a sleep on the ground, Claude?",
        "It is safe to take sleep in the tree's top. Why would you chose the dangerous ground instead?",
        "I do not know what is meant by the sleepies, but getting in the tree's top is easy. And you will be using all of your energy, so that good sleep will find you up in the tree.",
        "Give it some trying. And do not think with too much hardness when you return to the ground. Feel it. If you stop for thinking, your arms will get heavy.",
        "I have not known a noble here who can climb trees. Is this a weakness of Fódlan nobles?",
        "You should be quitting. It is a danger to be falling from such a height.",
        "You should take your sleep on the ground. I will take mine in the tree.",
        "Claude? Where...are you?",
        "Claude! I thought you were not able to climb the trees?",
        "I have much admiration for that! To climb is a skill with value.",
        "I am understanding. That costs more time though, so it is not the best thing for hunting. But you are not harming the tree, so that is...an advantage. I am liking this technique.",
        "The tree has a spirit. If you hurt the tree, you will give its spirit anger.",
        "Trees give us food and also shelter. We are needing them, and they are needing us.",
        "Yes. I do not know this goddess, but I know nature. That is the knowing I prefer to have.",
        "Claude? What are you doing?",
        "Why is that for you to do?",
        "You are a noble who does not have fear of working with hardness or becoming dirty. And you can climb trees. I am...impressed.",
        "I have your same opinion. Status is something chosen by chance, not by a person. Everything became different when I came from Brigid to the Empire. Nobility does not stop life from surprising you.",
        "Claude, you are...very much strange for a noble.",
        "I am normal in Brigid. In Fódlan, you are an...abnormality.",
        "I think also that your heart is kind. I am thinking you will be a good king.",
        "I will be helping you. We will join together our efforts.",
        "Yes. What is your need?",
        "You think I am not here, but you were calling for me?",
        "When I was arriving, I called out for Claude too. I was thinking it would give me joy if you were here.",
        "Yes, I think so. I like this tree. It gives me calmness.",
        "But...when the war has ended, I must be leaving this tree. I must be returning to Brigid. Claude... My grandfather has been saying i must be...must find a husband of Fódlan.",
        "If Fódlan and Brigid become bound by marriage, it will give my grandfather great joy.",
        "I am not having an obligation. I will only be marrying if I find a good person.",
        "No, I will be finding one. It will not be a problem.",
        "It is my secret. I will not be telling him yet.",
        "I am not knowing about the future. But my perfection...my perfect husband could be him. And if he gives refusal, I will be tying him up and dragging him home.",
        "Hello, Hubert. Yes, I am trying to be... industrious. I must be working hard to improve my position. Right now it is not a good one.",
        "Rub? I will not be rubbing on anyone!",
        "I had more youth then. And the experience was... terrifying. My grandfather ordered me to go to Fódlan with suddenness. I was stolen to a strange land filled with strange people. The treatment I was receiving was like... like I was a strange beast.",
        "It gave me sadness to leave my home, but I am not unhappy that I came to the Empire. I have learned much understanding from the outside world. My experience has made me become who I am. And meeting you and Lady Edelgard has had great value for me.",
        "Yes. There are some times I cannot stop my thoughts from going home. It will be much time before I return. Brigid feels... far away.",
        "It is as you say. When I return to Brigid... I will be the new queen. I am wishing to help relations with the Empire.",
        "Not Edelgard's equal, is that what you are saying?",
        "That is not a difference of equal... of equality. It is a difference of power.",
        "I can see with clarity the difference between me and Lady Edelgard. But that has no matter. I would never lose.",
        "Hubert, I have a request to give you, if I may be doing that?",
        "You are always comparing me against Edelgard. I have been observing you, and you are not often making comparisons like that. So why are you always comparing me? I do not enjoy being compared.",
        "That is not making sense to me... In battle, you and I are the same. Neither of us has a higher rank than general. Edelgard is leading the entire army, but you and I are both leading a part of the army. That should be making us... what is it... Ah! Comrades in arms.",
        "When you are looking at me, you are thinking of me compared to Edelgard. But I want you to be looking at me only as myself. Do you have understanding? I do not want you seeing me as foreign royalty, but as your comrade in arms, who is working with you at your side.",
        "Do you really think you can stop comparing? I am knowing well that Edelgard takes a big place inside your heart.",
        "Hm... For now, that will be OK. But I will not be giving up on this. And I want you knowing that one day, when you are comparing, you will be finding I have one the comparison.",
        "Be marking my words, Hubert. One day, between the two of us, you will be choosing me.",
        "Ferdinand? Our professor is wanting to see you...",
        "He has much concentration right now. I will wait for him to be finished reading.",
        "A short time. You were devoting all of your attention to that book.",
        "I am studying the history of Fódlan.",
        "I am wishing to learn all about Fódlan. What is the book you are reading?",
        "Yes, it is interesting. I see why you would be enjoying that kind of reading.",
        "I give you my gratitude. Research of weapons could be a good reference for me. Oh, please take my apologies. I was meaning to tell you that our professor is wanting to see you.",
        "Yes, it is a rarity that I forget something. But it is not impossible.",
        "Yes, taking care of the weapons has great importance.",
        "No, it is a weapon of Dagda. But the people of Brigid use... I mean, used them often.",
        "Lots of weapons and fighting techniques came from Dagda to Brigid.",
        "I will. But it is difficult to explain fighting with words. We can try sparring, maybe?",
        "Let's have our beginning, then!",
        "Oh? Do you think you have understanding of the fighting techniques from Dagda?",
        "Brigid is stuck between Dagda and Fódlan. It is of much importance to hone our fighting techniques. I am of the royal family, but I am a warrior before that. I must fight to live and to protect my home.",
        "When I came to Fódlan... I felt disgraced from many things that I learned. But there is no disgrace in losing ignorance. We need to be learning and growing with each other, always.",
        "Ferdinand...",
        "No, I am not needing help. I was just thinking that you look... lonely.",
        "Yes... My plan is to be returning home. But if Brigid and Fódlan can be friendly, I will be able to have visits whenever I choose. Maybe it is even possible for me to be living in Fódlan.",
        "I do have the hope of returning one day, but Fódlan is also like a homeland to me now. I came to Fódlan nine years ago. I have been living half of my life here. My family is living in Brigid, but in Fódlan, I have new family and new friends.",
        "Yes! We will be winning, and you will not be dying!",
        "Things?",
        "Oh!",
        "Is that a truth?",
        "You have my gratitude, Ferdinand. All of it! I have loneliness just like you...but your words gave me great happiness. Please do what you are saying... and be a bridge for Fódlan and Brigid.",
        "Yes! One day we will be seeing that future!",
        "Yes? Are you wanting something?",
        "Which arm? My left or right?",
        "I am not understanding. Can you show me please?",
        "But I must correct this. Please.",
        "Or are you unable to do, and you can only teach?",
        "Then...please advise again.",
        "How can I be lifting up with no... no unnecessary moving?",
        "Locus...elasticity... Can you not just be showing me?",
        "Please. If you are showing me, I will learn it with quickness.",
        "Linhardt only likes talking. It is on myself to prevail...",
        "Linhardt. I have been waiting for much time. Please, watch me.",
        "How did you find that? I did more training.",
        "At least? It is still no good?",
        "My spearwork?",
        "Spear momentum...",
        "At the top of my swing...loosen my grip. And then the weight will...carry it down?",
        "You are very clever. I wonder why you have hatred for training.",
        "He does not use his cleverness. It is a very big waste.",
        "I want you to use your power, Linhardt...",
        "Linhardt, I need to be asking for your wisdom. Will you consent?",
        "I was hunting earlier and the land gifted me with lots of game.",
        "It was all brought by me to the kitchen, and then—",
        "No, I am not asking that. All of that work and care is given right after the hunting.",
        "Giving gratitude, bleeding, skinning, all has been done to be making very nice, fresh meat.",
        "That meat is sitting in the kitchen already.",
        "I want to be smoking the meat, so we can be preserving it. There is a big quantity of it.",
        "But I am without enough firewood for the smoking... I am needing more than I was thinking I would.",
        "The darkness has fallen outside, so it will be difficult to be collecting it right now.",
        "This meat will not be waiting that long. It will be going to waste. Please... Do you have any suggesting for what I can do?",
        "You have much wisdom for giving, so I am hoping you will be helping me.",
        "Is that factual? I was not knowing that! The wisdom you give is exceptional!",
        "I am giving you my gratitude, Linhardt. Now, let's be going.",
        "You have all the wisdom about choosing wood for smoking. I am wanting your assistance.",
        "It would give me great happiness... There is no one better than you for this task!",
        "Linhardt, please accept my apology. You are not deserving of this punishment...",
        "It was not worthless. It had great worth.",
        "You gave me great help so I could be smoking all of that meat. I give you my gratitude for that.",
        "You can be leaving if you are wanting to. I will not be telling anyone. This is my responsibility to take.",
        "The Complete Guide to Fódlan's Wildlife!",
        "I have so much happiness! You are full of amazement.",
        "Linhardt... Can I be asking you something?",
        "You are no longer saying I am bothering you. Instead you are helping me with my requests.",
        "What is the reasoning? Why am I not bothering you now?",
        "You are liking the hard work?",
        "If you are liking it, then I will keep working hard.",
        "With your wisdom, I can be working even harder than before.",
        "That means I will be needing your wisdom from now onward.",
        "With my strength and your wisdom, there is nothing we can't be doing.",
        "Caspar! Do you want to train with each other?",
        "You have had new training recently. And great improvements. I want great improvement too. Will you give me help?",
        "I am knowing that! I want that too. You teach. I learn. We both get more strength. It will be greatness.",
        "Yes, Caspar?",
        "I heard a question in your voice. Say it.",
        "OK. I will not be worrying. Can we begin the training?",
        "What am I knowing?",
        "Your father? He is of the military, in the Empire. I hear he has great skill.",
        "You... How long have you had this knowing?",
        "So, now you have the truth.",
        "Caspar. That equipment is new. It is suiting... it suits you.",
        "You get more strength each day. I do not want to be falling behind.",
        "No! Caspar, you are impressing to me. I want to be training with you.",
        "What is wrong?",
        "You are not the one who did the killing, Caspar. Our parents had... conflict, but we are not them. I have no worry about it. You should not either.",
        "You must. If not, the conflict... will keep carrying on. If children cannot forgive, it will not ever have an ending. is that what you are wanting?",
        "Please, give it some thinking. I will be leaving now.",
        "It is going well. I am not having any troubles right now.",
        "Caspar.",
        "You are the son of my father's killer. That means I must be killing you and taking revenge.",
        "Your optimism is not making sense. It is not possible that you are not having hatred for me. My father was killed. By the Empire. By your father. And so I will be impaling you on this blade to be satisfying a deep wish of mine.",
        "I am talking about my wish. Of course... I am also having another wish. An even deeper wish. I wish for you and I to keep being friends. To keep fighting and surviving together. When you are speaking of your father, it is with a proud smile that injures my heart. But that is only a small thing. You also are working harder than anyone I am knowing. So... I can't bring myself to be killing you.",
        "That must be the truth. More than all of it, I am not wishing to be losing you. it would give me great sadness.",
        "Caspar...",
        "You have my gratitude for your understanding. Hearing your words gives me great happiness. I was always feeling a... barrier between our hearts. I am sure I was also the one putting it there. But from now onward, I will be sharing all of my heart with you. My grief and anger, joy and love. All of it.",
        "Bernadetta, are you needing help with something?",
        "I...do not have that, no.",
        "What I am thinking? I am thinking that you remind me of prey.",
        "Yes. Like a rabbit in the tall grass. Always watching for enemies, and you flee at any sign of danger. You are quick also. I must be careful that I am not hunting Bernie when I take out my bow.",
        "You have similarities with prey, that is all I mean to be saying.",
        "There is no need to have concern. I will make sure my arrows are not hitting you.",
        "You do not need forgiveness, but it is yours, if you are wanting it. Was I saying something wrong?",
        "Bernadetta. Is this a trouble you are having? I heard that the duty to hunt is yours today.",
        "Do not be worrying. I can show you the way to hunt well.",
        "When you see a beast, you are thinking of it as an enemy. That is how prey thinks. You must think of the beast as food. That is how the hunter thinks.",
        "You pick the vegetables from the field. Those have life too. It is the same. You take a blade in your hand and take the lives of the vegetable. You cut their stalks and harvest without mercy. They do not scream, but you are still their killer.",
        "Fruit ripens and falls to the ground. The seeds sprout and a new life is born. That is life's cycle. It has cruelty, yes. But you must end life to eat. You must be killing to be living.",
        "It is the same for rabbits, deer, pheasants. The only difference being that they cannot cry out. You must do what you must do to be living in this world. It is your task.",
        "Feel it. There, in the grass. Prey is moving. Just like a vegetable in the wind. Give it an arrow, just like you would give a vegetable a blade. It is just your task.",
        "You are now a hunter. You have learned how to hunt.",
        "You have understanding now, I can tell.",
        "I have belief in you.",
        "Have luck, Bernie.",
        "I am settled. Everyone shows great kindness.",
        "You have my gratitude, but please do not call me princess. You are making my cheeks blush!",
        "I do wish for that, but there is no possibility. The ingredients are not found here.",
        "Wait, Dorothea. It is the thinking that counts. But your cooking is... what is the word... horrendous. That is what everyone is saying anyway.",
        "The thinking is enough for me. You have my biggest gratitude.",
        "I have no problems. My body is already able to relax.",
        "I am not having sleeping trouble.",
        "Dorothea, is filling my heart full...",
        "Dorothea, I want to be asking you a question.",
        "Why have you come to Garreg Mach? Is your goal different from the rest?",
        "Marrying money? That is not sounding like a good idea. Money would be a bad husband.",
        "But you treat me well. I have so much gratitude. Why do you show me such friendliness when I am not money?",
        "Yes, I have that hope too. But I have also been thinking of who is good for me.",
        "And still I am thinking we should be friends.",
        "Yes, we both have troubles.",
        "Yes, I am investigating useful fighting techniques.",
        "You are... feeling sick about battle? Ah! I understand. Yes, I am also wishing for this war to finish quickly.",
        "Yes, it is hard to be braiding your hair when it is damaged from lack of care.",
        "You may. This style of braiding has been passing... has been passed down through my family.",
        "Your words are delighting me. Braiding it does take up a great amount of time every day.",
        "I am really liking that idea. It would give me great happiness to have our hair match.",
        "Dorothea... Before, I had confusion. I thought you were being overly familiar. But then I gained understanding. Now I am knowing that is how you show your kindness, and I have much gratitude for that. It is impossible to be imagining life without you. You are... precious to me.",
        "If you will be crying, you can have my... Ah! My shoulder. For your crying.",
        "My shoulder will always be available to you.",
        "A reservation? For... my shoulder?",
        "If that is the truth, then will you be coming to Brigid with me?",
        "When this war is finished, I am wishing for you to be seeing my homeland.",
        "Cry...beating... Are you wanting to battle me?",
        "Sword or bow... Which are you fighting with? You have skill with both, I am thinking.",
        "I was asked to be coming here and do the shopping, but then this merchant gave me her challenge!",
        "We are needing vulneraries. Many people make use of them and our stock is lowly.",
        "The shopping was successful. You have my gratitude, Ashe.",
        "Bargaining for prices in Fódlan is...complicated. I am thankful for this bargain. Now the extra can be given back to our professor. I had learnings about the customs of Fódlan. I have gratitude for that too.",
        "Efficiency with money is a wonderful culture.",
        "Ashe, I need to give you more gratitude for the commoner techniques you showed me.",
        "Yes. It has made for many savings. I was telling the professor. We both are so happy.",
        "Hmm...",
        "For a lot of time, I was living in the Imperial capital. Then I came here, to the monastery. Both places contain many nobles and many chances to be learning noble customs.",
        "In Fódlan, the nobles are training for dancing since their youth. They have much skill.",
        "I have learned many customs of the nobles but few of the commoners. I am hoping you will teach me. Techniques, secret skills, anything. All of the things.",
        "That is not the truth. The technique for money saving could be helpful even for nobles. It has use for all the world!",
        "Commoner wisdom is only to be shared with commoners, then? I have understanding. Forbidden knowledge. Ashe, how about we make a bargain? We can be trading information. In Brigid, powerful curse techniques are passed down. And we can speak with the spirits. I can be teaching you these things.",
        "You will be showing me the secret techniques? I cannot be waiting!",
        "Ashe... I do not have familiarity with this alley.",
        "OK... I will be giving this my try. Oh! It has a delicious flavor! Ashe, what is the dish being called?",
        "A dish of infinite varieties... You would not be finding such a wonder in a restaurant for nobles. A commoner technique, indeed!",
        "I give you my gratitude, Ashe. I have learned a great many things about the commoner techniques.",
        "But I am feeling that our deal has been very... one-sided. Are you sure you are not needing anything in exchange? If you are not wanting any curses, I can offer other information in trade...",
        "Stop that? What am I stopping?",
        "You and I... are friends? Are you speaking truth?",
        "I have understanding. I will now be speaking whatever I wish! You are my friend. There are many things I am wishing for you to know...",
        "Yes. The architecture of this cathedral is very grand. Fódlan craftsmanship always makes me astounded. I have been hearing that all of its adornments have meaning and are all honoring the goddess.",
        "The goddess does not reside in Brigid. There are, however, many spirits there. Earth spirits, water spirits, wind spirits... Spirits dwell in all things. The ocean, for an example... The spirit of the ocean is with two faces. Its kind face is bestowing bountiful blessings... but its terrifying face is bringing disaster.",
        "Yes. I have great skill at sailing. However, to be swimming is what I really love.",
        "The ocean can feel shallow or deep, bright or dark... and it is filled with many creatures. There are always new things for discovery. On sunny days, I like to be diving under the clear surface of the ocean and to be looking up at the sky from below... Those moments are my favorite. The sun shining through the blue water... It can be making even the water sparkle like gems.",
        "I am having an idea. When this war is over, we should be going to Brigid... with each other.",
        "A knight... Very well. I will be establishing an order of knights for you in Brigid.",
        "I am going to become the queen of Brigid. Ashe... You will become my guardian knight. Do not have fear. I will be making your dream come true.",
        "We will be diving into the ocean with each other, and be gazing up at the sky from behind the waves. I give you this promise. I hope you are understanding.",
        "Please take my apologies, Ignatz. I did not have enough care.",
        "Glasses... Ah, yes! Transparent lenses for viewing things.",
        "Hmm, your face looks different without the glasses.",
        "Are these them?",
        "I have no wounds. And you?",
        "That is goodness. How long have you needed the lenses, anyway?",
        "In Brigid, glasses are not existing. I think all of our eyes must be good there.",
        "Inside the shadows, dangerous beasts are lurking. If you cannot see, you cannot live.",
        "You need to have sight for hunting too. If not, you will starve until death.",
        "I wonder why eyes would change and need lenses...",
        "Ignatz! I am having a request.",
        "Yes. Only you can be helping me.",
        "I want to borrow your lens...your glasses. I have curiosity.",
        "I have so much gratitude! I will be trying them now.",
        "The world appears...blurred. My head feels dizzy.",
        "The danger for being sick is now...very high.",
        "I am feeling much better now. You have my thanks.",
        "Yes. I do not have friendliness with glasses.",
        "Like Heroes' Relics, only certain people can be using them.",
        "It is not for a joke...",
        "I was saying the truth.",
        "Your glasses are only for you to use. But I give thanks for you showing them to me.",
        "Ha! Hyah! Ha!",
        "Ignatz. Are you wanting something from me?",
        "Apologize? I will give you my forgiveness, but I am not understanding.",
        "You are learning new things from me? What kind of learning?",
        "I am thinking you also have great seriousness. That is why you are worrying.",
        "But your worrying is not necessary.",
        "Also, you have much kindness.",
        "You are apologizing for the smallest of things. Your heart is overfilled with compassion.",
        "You have honesty too. You are a good person.",
        "You are also having the ability to wear lenses! You are like...a hero chosen by the lenses.",
        "That final one was joking. I do not always have to be serious.",
        "It is greatly important for us to be understanding each other.",
        "Then we can be spending much more time with each other and learning much!",
        "Alois!",
        "I have a question to be asking you.",
        "You are always surrounded by people. When you speak, they smile. I feel envy. I want to know the secret to having a happy conversation.",
        "Start conversations. Stop sneaking. I am understanding. Is there more?",
        "What are you saying? Why are you laughing?",
        "A joke? Can you give me more explanation?",
        "You are...playing with your words. We do such things in Brigid too. In Fódlan, you have a strange way of playing with a word's meaning. I am admiring of it!",
        "Am I hurting them?",
        "More laughing. This must be a complex technique for word playing...",
        "Our hunting had great success today.",
        "You wish to know the secrets?",
        "I was asked to tell the secrets of my hunting.",
        "Training is the most important for hunting. You can start by...breaking the eyes! Huh?!",
        "That technique was an incredible one. You are the most comedic genius in all of Fódlan.",
        "I have been called a funny one. It is all because of your doing, Alois!",
        "I want even more improvement. I wish for you to instruct me all day. Will you be agreeing, Professor Alois?",
        "Shamir. You are training away from the ground of training.",
        "I have understanding. Rain training can cause unhealthiness. Can I give you a question now?",
        "You come from Dagda, I think. Why are you working at the monastery?",
        "But, Fódlan is an enemy for you, right? Are you feeling OK about that?",
        "I have gratitude for your answering. You have given me understanding.",
        "The fault is not of Dagda. My father made his own choice to be joining the war. I cannot say I have no hatred for the Empire, but I do not have any for Edelgard. When I came here, she was always helping me.",
        "You speak with such honesty. It is very amazing.",
        "Shamir. Can I be having your time? There is a thought that is giving me great concern.",
        "If Dagda is ever invading Fódlan again, what will you be doing?",
        "If that is the truth, then I am having one more question for you. If that was happening, and all of us were fighting for Fódlan...would you be fighting your allies in the Imperial army too?",
        "So, that is your truth...",
        "Hm?",
        "You are not fighting for money now?",
        "Hearing that is giving...it gives me great joy. Until the war is finished, let us fight together.",
        "Cyril. You are always having great passion and hard work. You give inspiration!",
        "There is no need for showing humility. You work with hardness... I mean, you work hard. It makes me have curiosity. Can you tell me what plans you hold for the future?",
        "I have had the learning that you are from Almyra. Everyone has the saying that it may have...may be hard to move up in the church for you. But even with that, you always have passion and work with hardness! What fills you with determination?",
        "I understand the feeling of need for repaying debts. But does it give you difficulty, being a great distance from your home for so much time?",
        "Yes. I have understanding. You and I...have similarities. But, at the similar time, we have differences.",
        "Cyril...does not want to speak about his land of home? It gives me curiosity...",
        "Hello, Cyril! I was doing training for hunting.",
        "I am good, but to keep good, I must keep practicing.",
        "My training and my land of home... Before I can give answers, I must give you my history. I was a child in Brigid. But then there happened the war with the Empire. My parents were...they died. Brigid lost in the war. After it, a decision was had that I must go to the Empire.",
        "Yes. But our difference is that I still have a strong devotion to my land of home. I want to grow my skills and train with hardness for the goodness of my land of home. I will one day be leading Brigid. I want to have better relations with Fódlan. So, that is why I am here when I wish I could be there.",
        "We have differences, but we do not have so many differences. You and I are the same, I believe.",
        "You work with great passion. All for the future and...to keep protected what is here today. I work for the future of my land of home. You are the same, but here is your home.",
        "That is what I have said. You and I are the same, even with the differences we have.",
        "Cyril. How is your bow training progressing?",
        "That is a nice thing to be hearing! You have my support with your efforts.",
        "Yes. I am always cheering you on. I am long feeling a great affinity with you. Our positions are dissimilar, but our situations have great similarities. That is why I am always trying hard to be supporting and protecting you.",
        "You will? That gives me great joy!",
        "Words can be said by anyone. Alone, they are without power. What is meaningful is...how you are feeling. I am hoping I can learn to use words well, to convey my feelings. That is my wish. I am still learning... My words are not coming out as properly as I am wanting.",
        "You have already been achieving that goal. You already have great strength.",
        "Stronger and stronger? So you can be supporting me forever?",
        "Even when I am being an old woman? It will be a difficulty then. Hehehe!",
        "Old woman Petra and old man Cyril, supporting each other. I am looking forward to it!"

        "Hngh... Hngh... Hngh... Ungh... Hngh... Hngh... Phew... Oh, Professor! Are you here to train?",
        "Legs, back, chest, arms, abs. Gotta work 'em all, right? I just finished training and I feel great. Check me out! Are my muscles bulging?",
        "Another day of training and my muscles are ready to burst! Bulging muscles mean strength. I have to be strong if I want to be a proper knight. And I have to eat if I wanna keep training. Time to feast!",
        "Ah, way to hit me where it hurts, Professor. I know I'd be in big trouble if I don't train my brain too. Anyone who can't get tactics, can't be a proper knight. It's just... I'm no good at remembering that kind of stuff. And train my brain instead of my body makes me sleepy! What if I start training twice as hard? Then I should only have to study half as much, right?",
        "You really think so? I can't let that happen! I guess I have no choice. I'll prove I can do it! Wish me luck, Professor! For my training and for my studies!",
        "Great timing, Professor! I was just going to come find you.",
        "Are you busy? I have a question about formations. I don't understand them at all. Are the speed of battle and the terrain connected somehow? There's too much to memorize!",
        "I don't? Then what do I have to know? I think I understand the basics. To start, you just...",
        "Ah! OK. I think I've got it! Thanks for the help, Professor! Brains and brawn, you've really got it all. With your help, I should have no trouble becoming a proper knight!",
        "Huh? Didn't I tell you? My parents were merchants of the Alliance. They died in an accident. That's why it's up to me to look after my little sis. I'm not great with bookkeeping, so I didn't think I'd make a good merchant. I talked to Grandpa and he suggested I become a knight. So I sold all our valuables and used the money to pay my way into the academy. My sis won't survive if I get kicked out, so I can't give up now!",
        "I might have tried being a mercenary if I didn't have my little sis to look after. I probably shouldn't say this, but being a mercenary does sound like an easier life. Mercenaries have no responsibilities, and no one else to worry about. But someone's gotta take care of my little sis, so that's out of the question. Serving as a knight in a noble house is more secure, and you don't have to worry about dying...unless there's a war. My sis has been through so much. I don't want her to have to worry about me. Hey. Do you have any siblings, Professor?",
        "Then you probably think I'm missing out on my freedom, having to support her, huh? But, working hard for my sister isn't too bad. Call it a burden, call it a challenge. If it makes my sister happy, I'm happy too! You should ask your father to have some more kids! Anyway, that's why I've got to become a proper knight!",
        "Hey, Professor! I think you've been working too much lately. The battle's gonna keep going with or without you, but you're the one doing the most out there! It's real impressive how you can focus on giving orders and fighting! I don't think I could do both in the same battle. I see you running all over the place, even after the battle is over. I just don't want you to wear yourself out.",
        "No offense, Professor, but don't you think some folks might be taking advantage of you? Claude keeps asking you to do things, but you never say no. Like when you gave that speech to the troops. That didn't seem like something you wanted to do. I know you gotta follow orders on the battlefield, but you should have to do things off the battlefield if you don't wanna.",
        "What do you mean? Like studying? Sure it's not my favorite thing in the world, but that was to keep my little sis fed. I had good reason for it.",
        "The same, huh? I think I get what you mean. You do things you don't wanna do for the sake of everyone else. That's real noble of you, Professor. I guess I can't get in your way if you're doing it for the right reason. OK, then. I'm gonna keep trying to do my best, but now I'm gonna do it for you. My little sis is important to me, but you're real important too. I always work hard for the people who matter to me. And having more of them in my life just means I gotta work even harder! What do you think?",
        "Really?! I wasn't expecting you to say that! You're gonna make me blush! We gotta keep working hard together then. At least until this war's over. I'll work hard to make sure you don't collapse from exhaustion! You've got nothing to worry about, Professor. I've been training nonstop. I got your back, no matter what!",
        "Hngh... Hngh... Hngh... Ungh... Hngh... Hngh... Phew... Oh, Professor! Are you here to train?",

        "You're probably right. Even you need a break every once in a while! The war's finally over, but they're still putting you to work, huh? I betcha it's going to get pretty busy from here on out.",
        "Fódlan sure has changed a lot since you were our professor. Some places that lost their leaders...and other ones got wrecked from all the fighting. You gotta decide what to do about the church now too, huh?",
        "Hahaha! Even I understand that much! I'd never become a great knight if I didn't!",
        "You bet I do! That's what I've been working toward all this time! I'm not sure you heard, but apparently the battles I fought in made me famous! Folks started calling me \"the Beast of Leicester.\" Can you believe that? People calling me a Beast! I was offended at first, but my little sis said it made me sound tough. She must be right, 'cause I've had people asking me to work for them nonstop! I've made my decision though. I know whose knight I wanna be. Speaking of... I got this for you. Will you accept it?",
        "Ma...m-m-ma-- Marry me and let me be your knight! Please! Remember how I told you how important you are to me? Well, I wanna be with you and stay by your side! I thought maybe if we got married, then we could always be together.",
        "It's awfully nice of you to worry about her, but she'll be fine. I barely took my eye off her and she grew up into an adult! It won't be easy, but I want her to do whatever's gonna make her happy. I'll still keep an eye on her, but she'll be off on her own soon. I guess what I'm saying is, don't worry about her. She'll be OK. I'm more worried about you! You gotta rebuild this world from scratch! That's a whole lotta weight for one person to carry. Enough to crush you. So, will you let me help you? It's a heavy load, but I wanna carry it with you. What do you say? Will you let me be your knight?",
        "You...love me? Yes! Yes, yes, yes! '''From now on and for the rest of forever, this Beast is gonna stay by your side! But wait. I can't just be a physically strong Beast. I gotta have a strong mind too! Whatever you need, I'll work as hard as I can! As hard as anyone! I'll keep training to make sure you can count on me. And...I'll love you. Forever and ever. And ever!'''",
        "Hey, Dimitri! I heard about what you did!",
        "Some folks are saying you lifted a whole wagon on your own, and you made it look easy!",
        "You gotta teach me your training secrets! I wanna build muscles like that!",
        "Oh, c'mon! You don't have to keep your secrets from me!",
        "I wanna be really strong like you. I don't just wanna, I gotta! I've had to provide for my little sis ever since our parents died. If I wanna do that, I gotta get strong so I can become a knight!",
        "Really?! Aw, yeah!",
        "You had to run all night in heavy armor? That sounds tough! What else did you do?",
        "Got it! I'm gonna give that a try right now!",
        "You shouldn't worry so much. I know my limits! My muscles are gonna be so big after this!",
        "Urgh... Dimitri...",
        "I think... I think... I think I'm gonna die!",
        "My whole body... It's stinging and aching... I've never felt anything like it! I feel weak all over. I don't have the energy to do anything. This has never happened to me before!",
        "Thing is, I already tried going there, but I didn't see Manuela or the monks... / Thing is, I already tried going there, but I didn't see any of the monks who are usually around... Dimitri, listen. If anything happens to me, I need you to take care of my little sis...",
        "At this rate I won't even be able to fight alongside everyone else! / At this rate I won't even be able to fight alongside everyone else!",
        "Well, first I ran all across the mountains while carrying a gigantic boulder. Then I found a big log and lifted it a few hundred times. After that, I ran 50 laps around Garreg Mach wearing heavy armor. Then I tied a rope to a barrel full of rocks and swung it around for a while.",
        "I train every day, but yesterday I decided to try out some new techniques. I took the ideas you gave me and used them to come up with a whole new regimen.",
        "Muscle...pain? I don't understand.",
        "Wait, wait, wait. If this is muscle pain, does that mean I hurt my muscles?",
        "I can't believe I was so mean to my muscles! I need to make it up to them!",
        "I gotta go eat some food so my muscles can get the nutrition they need! And I can't waste any more time talking about it!",
        "Aaghh! My muscles!",
        "Hrgh... Ughh... Nghh... There we go. Time for a break!",
        "It was my turn to do the shopping again, but I might have overdone it.",
        "I was passing by the smithy and the old man called me over. He said he was finished repairing the training weapons, so I grabbed them since I was already there.",
        "I had just left the smithy when I ran into a merchant I recognized. He said he had some books that he brought for the library, so I took them off his hands.",
        "Oh, this? Can you believe someone threw this away? It only needs a little work and it'll be good as new! Someone around here was just saying that they needed a desk.",
        "Haha. Well, I, uh, worked up an appetite from carrying all of this stuff, so, uh... I had a snack on my way back.",
        "All of this stuff is pretty heavy. Are you sure you can handle it?",
        "Ungh... Rrgh... Nrgh... Phew! Time to rest.",
        "Heh, it's almost like this stuff is drawn to me whenever I'm in town! I'm just happy I can use my muscles to help out around here.",
        "I heard that proper knights always help those in need. Isn't that right?",
        "If someone virtuous becomes a knight, they'll be a virtuous knight, right? That's about as proper as you can get!",
        "So, you're saying I'm the type of knight you'd want to hire for House Riegan?",
        "I'm not gonna stop helping others, but you can do me all the favors you want. All this talk of being proper is making me hungry. For my first favor, why don't you bring me a snack?",
        "Hey! Caspar! You work your muscles almost as much as I do.",
        "Ain't that the truth. Let's get to it then!",
        "Ughh... Ughh... You might be right. I'm exhausted!",
        "I know I'm big. Everyone knows that. What are you talking about?",
        "is that all? I know how to fix that!",
        "Follow me!",
        "That's right. Now sit down and eat up!",
        "Yup. Eating's the best way to get bigger! You gotta eat, and you gotta train. Do 'em both enough and you're sure to grow.",
        "Probably both. Look at my plate compared to yours. Now this is a meal!",
        "That's the spirit! C'mon! Let's go clear out the pantry.",
        "Caspar! Good to see you! You're looking a bit bigger lately!",
        "Is something wrong? I thought you wanted to get bigger. Have you been training?",
        "Aww, that's too bad. I always thought that the secret to getting bigger was lots of eating and training! You know what? You shouldn't worry so much about how big or tall you are. You're great, no matter what size!",
        "Well, let's see... You can run faster than me. And you're really agile, which I will never be. That's just about your legs though. your other movements are quick too! You can dodge good, and swing a sword pretty fast. Oh! And your...",
        "Huh? I think it's normal size, but...",
        "Yeah! Maybe...",
        "I have no idea, but I'm always up for a meal.",
        "Raaww! Hrrnngghh! Hrraaggh! Yrraagh! Hyaaaggh—huh? What's that noise? Heh... Sounds like someone's having fun. Maybe it's coming from the greenhouse.",
        "'''' That was amazing!",
        "What? I'm no flower.",
        "I did! What kind of instrument was that? I could hear it all the way over at the training grounds. It was great. I didn't know you could play!",
        "That's right. Then I came here to tell you how good you sounded!",
        "Uhhh...no? But that's a great idea. Everyone should be able to hear your music!",
        "I don't know what just happened, but I think I might have scared her...",
        "Ahh! Bernadetta! Please, c-calm down!",
        "Please! Listen! I only came to hear you play. That's it. Promise. I'm not gonna make you perform in front of everyone else. I just wanted to hear you myself.",
        "Really. I kept trying to ask, but you always ran away.",
        "You're right. I'm sorry. I just didn't know how else to get your attention. You get so scared. But it looks like I ended up scaring you anyway. I'll leave you alone, Bernadetta... I really just wish I could have heard you play.",
        "Oh! Bernadetta! Sorry, just passing through. Didn't mean to scare you again...",
        "Huh? What do you have to apologize for?",
        "Come on, now. It's all right. I wasn't really that bothered by it. Promise. I shoulda been more careful not to scare you. I'm a big guy, and my muscles can be intimidating.",
        "How about this? Let's say it's both our fault and call it even. But you know, I've been thinking... You really are scared of everything. Is there something we can do to fix that?",
        "Something like that. I think we can figure this out. Your biggest fear is talking to people, right? If that's the case, you need to change the way you think about talking! Right now you think it's bad so you're afraid to do it. I figure if you talk to more people, then you'll think talking is good! It might be hard to suddenly start talking to people though... You're gonna need to take it slow. Oh! I know! Start with me!",
        "I guess...if that's what you need. '''' How's this?",
        "I bet if you get used to talking to me, your fears will go away in no time!",
        "Sure is! Staring up at the sky on a clear day always reminds me of my hometown.",
        "Hmm...let's see... Well, it's a real calm and peaceful place. Big, clear skies too, just like this. It's full of friendly people and delicious food. Talking about it makes me want to go back.",
        "Right? I wonder what my little sis is up to. She's probably grown so much by now... I haven't seen her since I came back to Garreg Mach. She probably wouldn't even recognize me anymore.",
        "You really think so? That's a relief. All this relief's making me hungry! Want to head to the dining hall?",
        "Oh yeah? I won't say no to that!",
        "Meat? That's my favorite! I'd probably eat it even if it was poisoned! Om mmm mmm... Mmm? Mmm mmm...",
        "Graaah! That was amazing!",
        "So tender! So juicy! So full of flavor! It was practically falling off the bone! The flavor was so rich and sweet! I— Wait...how can meat be sweet?",
        "No, no, no! It was delicious! I couldn't believe it! I'd eat more fruits and vegetables if they were this good! If all food tasted like this I...I just don't know what I'd do with myself!",
        "Really?! That would be great! We gotta get this war over with so you can have more time to cook!",
        "Mmm...this meat is so good! I wish I could send some home to my little sis.",
        "Oh! I was just enjoying some of this roast! Did you want a bite?",
        "Hahaha! That's funny. Of course I know this isn't the dining hall!",
        "Is that the best way to eat? If you think so, let's sit down!",
        "I don't have a plate with me, so there's nothing I can do about that now. But since when are you so proper, Ingrid?",
        "Slow down! I can't do all this listening while I'm trying to eat!",
        "Now you need everything to be neat and tidy? You're really particular.",
        "Wait. All I have to do is be neat and tidy and I can become a knight? Forget all that studying then, I'm just gonna work on being the neatest and tidiest one here!",
        "Ugh. Really? You're probably right. I shouldn't bother with the neat and tidy stuff.",
        "Huh? Is that Ingrid? I'd better get outta here before she scolds me again.",
        "Actually...she looks kinda sad. Maybe I shouldn't run away...Hey! Ingrid! Why do you look so sad? Are you hungry or something?",
        "You're not hungry...but you're sad anyway? I don't get it. Are you sick?",
        "Then are you sure you're not hungry?",
        "Well, sometimes you gotta talk it out. That's what my grandpa says.",
        "Of course! Please, go ahead.",
        "I see. I see.",
        "Ahhh, I see. I see.",
        "Hmmm...I see. I see.",
        "I'm right there with you, but-",
        "Sorry. All that listening made me hungry! After hearing you out, I think you're probably just hungry too, and your troubles are sure to go away after a good meal!",
        "Whaddaya mean? The dining hall's where I do most of my eating.",
        "Of course not, Ingrid. A proper knight has to be neat and tidy.",
        "It's all thanks to you. You said I had to clean up if I wanted to be a knight, so I started being more careful. Do you think I have what it takes now?",
        "Maybe I'd have a better chance if I just married you!",
        "You're real cultured, that's all. You already taught me to be neat and tidy. I figure you could teach me lot more about being a proper knight if I always had you around!",
        "You're right. Probably a better idea to just embolden each other instead. As long as I still get your help with becoming a proper knight!",
        "Huh? I don't know about that. I'm pretty tough. But I guess if anyone can beat me, it'd probably be you, Ingrid! Guaranteed!",
        "Mmm... Mmm... Ah! Meat is the best! Veggies and fish are great too, but, uh, there's nothing quite like a good cut of meat.",
        "Hey, Lorenz! You here to eat? It looks like you barely grabbed anything!",
        "No wonder you're so skinny! My little sis eats more than you! Come on, have some of mine. You need it more than I do.",
        "You're pretty touchy, huh? It's probably because you're hungry!",
        "Why can't you enjoy your meal? You don't like what's on the menu?! You wait here. I'll go to the kitchen and find something tastier for you!",
        "I don't think you get it, Lorenz. Nothing goes with a meal better than good company! If leading the Alliance is your goal, you should really try eating with other people first.",
        "If you want to be a leader, you have to know how to get along with different types of people, right? If you really want to get to know someone, all you have to do is share a meal with them.",
        "The more you eat with someone, the more you learn about them. Their likes, their dislikes. You know? You might get some of their food that way too! You can eat more and bulk up! Hahaha! All that talking made me hungry again. I'm gonna go get seconds!",
        "Ah! So hungry! I gotta eat something!",
        "Really? I can have this? But don't you need to eat after all that training?",
        "S-seriously? Wow! That's awful generous of you! Thank you so much!",
        "Urmm... Mmm... Mmm... Ahh... That was tasty!",
        "Oh, hey! I sent my little sis some of that fancy meat you gave me a while back. She wrote back to say that it was tasty and to thank you. So, thanks!",
        "Yup, it's just like I told you. Food tastes better when you eat with good company!",
        "I could probably keep eating, but I'm ready to train. All right! Time to get back to it so I can protect my buddy Lorenz.",
        "But if you hadn't given me food just now, I couldn't survive on the battlefield because I'd be too weak to train! Who'd take care of my little sis if I wasn't around? She'd probably end up starving to death as well! In a way, by feeding me you're protecting her too!",
        "You're a real decent noble, you know that? Worrying so much about my sister and all. All I gotta do is protect you, then you protect everyone else, right?",
        "Yes! Time for food! Hey, Ignatz! Is this seat taken?",
        "Really? But there's still food on your plate.",
        "Oh. OK.",
        "Hey, Ignatz! Wanna train with me?",
        "What's the matter? It always looks like that! Come on, we'll take care of it later.",
        "Hey, Ignatz!",
        "Are you busy? I need to talk to you.",
        "Hey, hey, hey! Hold up! Are you seriously gonna keep running away from me?",
        "yes, you are! Every time I try to talk to you, you make up some excuse and run! What's going on? You were a lot friendlier to me when we were kids. You were always so excited to show me all the neat stuff you had whenever I came to visit. We'd play hide-and-seek with my little sis, draw pictures and do other fun stuff too! Remember all that?",
        "Regrettable? What's there to regret?",
        "What're you talking about? My parents died in an accident while traveling for work.",
        "Huh... I didn't know that. But what does that have to do with our friendship?",
        "Oh, I see. But we're done talking about this. You gotta stop beating yourself up over it. It was an accident.",
        "Yah! Hurr! Hyah!",
        "Hey, Ig—",
        "I-Ignatz?",
        "Hey! Ignatz is here!",
        "What's gotten into him?",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, you've been acting weird lately. Are you sick or something?",
        "So, what's going on with you? Are you worried about something? Wanna talk about it?",
        "Hey, now!",
        "I thought I told you to drop it? Just forget about it!",
        "Well, what were they supposed to do about it? It's not like they killed my parents. And besides, that's our folks you're talking about. That's got nothing to do with us, right?",
        "Look, if you wanna do something, just be my pal like you used to. We can eat tasty meals together, play games, make jokes, and laugh until our bellies hurt!",
        "Of course it is! We were friends before, and there's no reason we can't be friends now!",
        "Well, if it isn't ol' Ignatz! I got a message here from my sis.",
        "Nah, she's still a shrimp. It's been a while since I saw her, but she's probably only up to your shoulders.",
        "I wrote to tell her about how we're friends again. Do you remember this?",
        "She sent it along with the letter. I guess she held onto it since we were kids! All right. That's enough looking. She said to show it to you and send it right back.",
        "You're much better now, so it must be paying off! I bet you could be a real artist!",
        "Who cares what your parents want? It's not like you're a noble or nothing. Your fate is your own!",
        "I know so. And I'm gonna support you with whatever dream you got. OK. Lemme see... What's the first step to follow your dreams...oh! Got it! You should paint me!",
        "Yeah! I want my little sis to know how good I'm doing here, so I gotta send her proof. Plus, she'll be doubly impressed if it's a painting you made!",
        "My face? No way. You gotta get my muscles in there! Mostly my chest and arms.",
        "Wait! Before you start painting, I gotta get me a little more training in! If my muscles aren't bulging, then what's the point?",
        "Hey, Lysithea. Your forehead's all wrinkled. You look tense. Is something wrong? You know you can tell your Big Bro Raph—I mean you know you can tell me anything, right?",
        "What does that mean? Oh, are you researching something complicated? In that case, yeah, you're probably right. Is there something else I can help you with? I'm really good at other things. Like training!",
        "I have an idea! Do you wanna get real good at playing tag? I could teach you!",
        "There's a trick to it that most people don't know. Like, to not get tagged and stuff. Let me show you!",
        "It's too sunny out to spend all day inside studying! C'mon, Big Bro's gonna take you outsi—",
        "Uhhh. Did I really say that out loud?",
        "Like I said, I'm really good at other things, just not classroom learning...",
        "Phew! She must be going through a rebellious phase!",
        "What's going on? Everything OK?!",
        "Lysithea? Oh wow. Look at the mess you made.",
        "Were you planning on carrying this much weight on your own?! Don't be ridiculous! You should've at least asked for help!",
        "I'm happy to help you carry some of them. How about half? That's fair, right?",
        "Hahaha! As smart as you are, you sure are a silly person. I'm so tough! I'm gonna stand my ground! I don't need help from anyone! And when things don't go my way, I'm gonna act all sad and moody!",
        "Huh? Oh, no! Sorry! I was imitating my little sister. Her name's Maya. She's way smart, but she can be pretty stubborn. You remind me of her. What I mean to say is that I want to help, so swallow your pride and ask.",
        "I'll be carrying this stack of books now. Got a problem with that?",
        "All right! Is this a good spot to drop 'em?",
        "Wow, talk about picky.",
        "Fine, fine!",
        "Need help with something, Lysithea?",
        "Want me to just grab one for you?",
        "No problem! You can sit on my shoulders instead! Up you go!",
        "No problem at all! It was my pleasure!",
        "Yeah. I can't help but think about her whenever I see you around. We lost our parents when she was still real little, so she never had adults around to do stuff for her. That's probably why she grew up to be the kinda kid who wants to do everything on her own.",
        "I keep telling her that it's OK to rely on her big bro a little bit. Like when there's stuff she can't do 'cause she's too small. She just needs to ask someone bigger to do it! I told her that she could help me when I'm having trouble with stuff too. Then we would be even.",
        "It is simple! I knew you get it!",
        "Hmm... All right then. You can help me clean up my room!",
        "If you could help with the actual tidying, that would probably be better. No need to bother with 'rules'. I don't really do so good with remembering the complicated stuff. Oh! I got an idea! It would be even better if you could just came by to tidy up from now on!",
        "If you keep helping me, then I can help you whenever you need it! No guilt!",
        "From now on! Like, for always! I don't know what's so difficult to understand...",
        "Hey, Marianne! Whatcha eating? Mind if I join you? I'm starving!",
        "All my favorite dishes are on the menu today! I might have grabbed too much. You want some?",
        "All you've got on your plate are leaves! Are you sure that'll fill you up?",
        "Huh? You're already done eating? But there's still food on your plate! Hey! Marianne! Huh. Maybe she's not feeling well. I should probably go check on her later.",
        "Oh! I found Marianne! I didn't know she spent her time here. It sounds like she's talking to someone...",
        "Hey, Marianne! Who're you talking to?",
        "Huh? Oh, the birdie flew off...",
        "You were acting a little strange when we were eating earlier, so I wanted to check on you. I was worried.",
        "Are you sure? Well, that's good to hear. As long as— Wait a minute! Were you just talking to a bird?",
        "Hah! I knew it! You can talk to birds! I'm right, aren't I?",
        "That's incredible! This place is full of interesting folks, but I didn't think anyone spoke birdie!",
        "Amazing! I hope I get to meet a bird who speaks human one day.",
        "Yeah, yeah. I get it, but you can't be so picky. You need some meat in your diet! I don't know if you can eat human food, but bug meat might be good for you. That's right, you need to eat plenty of bug meat if you want to get big and strong like me! No more sweets for you!",
        "Huh? Is someone there?",
        "Oh! Marianne! You're right on time! This little birdie was telling me that he misses you and — Ah, oh! Aww. It flew off.",
        "Why do you think birds fly away when there's more than one person around? Birds never seem to stay put unless I'm alone.",
        "You mean they're afraid of loud noises?! Oops! That was probably too loud for the birds. C'mon Raphael. Keep it down. How's this? Do you think we'd be able to talk to the birds together like this? I still haven't met a bird that can speak human. I was hoping you could introduce me.",
        "I was mostly talking at him, not to him. He just said \"chirp chirp\" and stuff like that. I had no idea what he was talking about. I don't think he understood me either.",
        "Marianne, you always know which birds understand what you're saying, right? Next time you find a bird who understands you, I hope you let me know so I can join the conversation!",
        "Marianne! Come here, quick!",
        "It's that bird you were talking to! I just found him!",
        "See? Right there on the lower branch! That's gotta be him, but he looks a little sad for some reason.",
        "Food?! I got it!",
        "Are you hungry, Mr. Bird? I got just what you need!",
        "Look at him go! He's loving it! He's gonna get so big and strong after this!",
        "I could tell by looking at him. He looked hungry and weak. More importantly, I saw what you did! That bird wasn't speaking human, so you gotta understand birdese! I knew it!",
        "Oh... I see. What about me, then? Can you tell what I'm thinking when you look at me?",
        "Well, of course not. You're not even looking at me! You gotta look at my eyes!",
        "I guess I just gotta tell you. I'm thinking it would be nice if you talked to me the way you talk to animals.",
        "Whenever you talk to animals, you seem happy and friendly! I just wish you'd talk to me like that too.",
        "What if I try this? Cheep cheep, chirree-chir-chidoo!",
        "Whoa! I've never heard you laugh before! I should've talked to you in birdese sooner!",
        "Cheep-chirrah, cheep-lee-woo, tweetle-dee!",
        "I said you gotta eat bugs to grow big and strong, just like Mr. Bird!",
        "Right, this goes here.",
        "Hey, Hilda! I'm just doing this! Hyaaah!",
        "Yeah! I just gotta polish it up and paint it, then the base of the necklace will be ready.",
        "How's it look? I bet it's the right size too. And this tree bark smells amazing! Now I just need to carve these boar tusks to hang from it.",
        "I almost forgot! I was gonna add these wolf claws too. And I could even add some color to them...",
        "Huh? Is something wrong, Hilda?",
        "You're right, it really does! Want me to make you one while I'm at it?",
        "It would definitely look good on me, but this one's actually a birthday present for my little sis.",
        "Something cute? What's wrong with something tough and rugged? This necklace is gonna have tusks and claws and stuff!",
        "If you say so. But where would I find a flower that was pretty enough?",
        "Fódlan's Throat? That's on the eastern edge of the Alliance! I'd have to leave now if I'm going to make it back in time.",
        "It's me! Raphael.",
        "And I got this too!",
        "Yeah, I finally got my hands on \"something cute,\" just like you suggested.",
        "Of course! I had to run to make it back in time. It was a lot farther than I thought!",
        "I figured I should follow your advice! You know more about what's stylish than I ever could.",
        "Yeah, about that... I don't know how to put it together. I spent so long the flowers have started wilting. There are only a few nice ones left.",
        "Seriously?! You're really gonna help me?",
        "Don't you worry about that! I'll find something really nice to pay you back with.",
        "Huh. Oh! Whoa! This is incredible! And so shiny! You're like an artist, Hilda! How'd you do this?",
        "What's this? The part you hang around your neck? I thought you'd use the one I gave you...",
        "It's gorgeous! Beautiful! I've never seen anything like it! Thank you, Hilda! ''''",
        "'''' It's just... I bet my sister never got anything so pretty in her whole life! She's had to deal with so much because of me! I never got her anything this nice and cute before! She's gonna love it... and be so happy...",
        "Don't-- Don't you always put effort into things?",
        "But what if they're not disappointed? Then they feel great, and you feel great too!",
        "What do you mean? Do you have a big bro too?",
        "I didn't do anything special, though. It's natural for a big bro to look after his little sis. Oh! That reminds me! I still haven't found anything special enough to repay you for the necklace. I got an idea though. How about I help you make a tough looking necklace for your big bro?",
        "Really? That's it?",
        "Of course we'll come and visit! I told my sis all about you and she already wants to meet ya!",
        "Uh... What?",
        "Hey, Leonie! Are you just getting back? Whoa! What's with the bag? It's huge!",
        "I'm happy to help! Where'd you go to get all this stuff?",
        "Whoa. It sounds like you did a lot of running around today.",
        "You planned all that out? Impressive! What are you gonna do with all the stuff you got?",
        "You really can't let anything go to waste, can you?",
        "Who knew you were so thoughtful! I mean, with actual thinking ahead. You're so generous to everyone and always making me food. I never knew how much thought you put into it!",
        "That makes sense. You gotta use up the stuff you've got, after all. Hey, do you think you're like this because you didn't have much growing up?",
        "Now you're speaking my language!",
        "Waaaugh!",
        "Oh! Leonie!",
        "I-I just got a thank you letter from my little sister!",
        "My little sister lives with my grandpa now. She's had to deal with so much now that I've decided not to take over the family business.",
        "Our parents were merchants, but they died in an accident. We had some money saved at first, but... But Grandpa isn't healthy enough to work, and I'm not smart enough to work a job that requires... much thinking.",
        "I had to sell all our valuables just to pay my way here so I could become a knight!",
        "My sister wants the best for me, but - she's the smart one in the family! She's the one that should be here! When I ask if she needs anything, she always says she's fine. She doesn't want to ask for anything 'cause she knows I'm having such a hard time here!",
        "It said she's happy and thankful for all the study materials I sent her!",
        "I couldn't find any, so I just sent her mine! It's like you said, right? It's better to give them to someone who will use them instead of letting them go to waste!",
        "You bet! Gotta reply to these things as soon as they come in!",
        "Yeah. Oh! That reminds me! My sister wrote to say how much she loved the painting supplies you sent!",
        "You even made her a brush! I really appreciate you doing all that for her.",
        "Sounds like you had a pretty rough time growing up, too, huh?",
        "Oh, wow. It's like all the kids in your village are counting on you.",
        "Yeah. It's like me and you are both carrying big weights. We should try sharing our weights with one another! You know, lighten both of our loads!",
        "If we share our problems, then we only gotta carry half the weight, right? It works out for everybody!",
        "Nah, that doesn't sound right. Everything's lighter when you don't gotta carry it alone.",
        "Now you're getting it! It's a waste of energy to struggle alone when there's someone who can help you!",
        "Great! And you should never fall short on sharing a big meal with me too!",
        "Huh? Oh, hello, Flayn!",
        "Oh, you scared me! You nearly knocked me over with that scream!",
        "I'm just out here using logs to train!",
        "Of course! Wanna see? Hrrnnggh! Yrrrraaah! See? Told you I could do it.",
        "Hmm. It might be a bit too much for your tiny arms.",
        "It's probably best to start by practicing your battle cry. If you let out a good shout, you'll feel even more powerful!",
        "No problem. Just follow my lead! Yaaah! Hrrrraaagh!",
        "Ooorraaah! Nggghaaarh!",
        "Umm. Heh...",
        "''' '''Of course! My muscles are always ready to train!",
        "''' '''Wow! That sounds much better than last time! But try doing it more like this. Urraaaggh! Hrraaah!",
        "''' '''Try not to strain yourself. You've got smarts, so you shouldn't need to have to worry about your muscles.",
        "''' '''I know what that's like. I have a little sister too. I always worry about her, even when it's something small, like catching a cold.",
        "''' '''Well, if you're having fun, I'm not gonna stop you! Go on and shout as much as you want! Give it all you've got and make your brother proud.",
        "''' '''All right! Gather all your energy deep in your gut and get ready to shout!",
        "''' '''Whoouugh! Hurrghaaah!",
        "''' '''Rraaagh! Hiiiyyaaah!",
        "''' '''Nice work! Here you go. Drink up!",
        "''' '''Your shouts are really coming from the gut now. I bet you're getting stronger too!",
        "''' '''Oh, no, thank you! I'm just happy to have someone to shout with.",
        "''' '''Nah. Don't worry about that. I think I'm in better shape now than I was before! My muscles work overtime when they hear you shouting so close to me!",
        "''' '''I'm sure they will! I used to think you were a lost cause, but look at you now! If you really wanna get there, you gotta start training your muscles while we shout, all right? You've already got big brains, but if we can get you big muscles too, you're gonna be invincible!"

        "Welcome, Professor. This is the first time I have welcomed you here, is it not? There is no need to be nervous. Please, come closer. When you speak with me here in this room, you are not speaking with the archbishop, but with Rhea. It's just me.",
        "Oh, my apologies. I should not be treating you like a child. As Jeralt's kin, somehow you don't seem at all a stranger to me... Speaking of Jeralt, may I ask if he ever spoke of me to you?",
        "Since you are here, shall I tell you about the Jeralt that I knew? By the look of it, you haven't heard much about his time at the monastery, have you? When I first met Jeralt, he was quite young. Why, he could not even grow a full beard at that point! On one fateful occasion, the band of mercenaries he belonged to fought alongside the Knights of Seiros. I was traveling with the knights at the time, and Jeralt jumped in front of an attack meant for me. He was gravely wounded. On the verge of death. I tended to his wounds in a desperate attempt to save his life. Thankfully, my efforts were not in vain. Jeralt managed to escape a seemingly certain death. I made arrangements for him to receive further care at Garreg Mach. The moment he was deemed fully recovered, I invited him to join the knights.",
        "Well, it is not a story I have often repeated. Even at the monastery, there are not many who know that. I tell you this because...to me, you are the child of the one who saved my life all those years ago. And also...",
        "Never mind. It is nothing. I simply wanted to say that I trust you. By coming to visit with me today, you have... Well... Suffice it to say that my day is brighter than it otherwise would have been. I thank you for that.",
        "Hello, Professor. It is so nice to see you here. It brings me great joy to now that you wished to visit with me again. I have this odd feeling that recently you've been trying to avoid me...",
        "In any case, I am delighted by this opportunity to speak with you again. My, how laughable I must seem! I imagine you must be dumbstruck by how unbecoming my behavior is for the archbishop of all of Fódlan...",
        "In any case, how are you feeling? Have you experienced anything strange since you began wielding the Sword of the Creator?",
        "Has there really been nothing odd? A tightness in your chest? Strange dreams? Anything of the sort?",
        "Please know that you are welcome to come to me about anything. I am here for you, always. By the way... When I see you at work, giving such splendid guidance to all of your students... I want you to know that it brings me great joy, as though I, myself, am receiving the benefit of your kindness.",
        "Hello there. I've been waiting for you. If you would, please allow me a closer look at your face. Those beautiful, shining eyes... And silken hair, so similar to my own...",
        "Oh dear, please excuse my rudeness. I forgot myself for a moment. It is only that we haven't had a chance to speak privately since you were blessed with the power of the goddess. I hope I have not caused you any discomfort.",
        "Yes. As souls blessed by a connection to the progenitor god, the bonds between us are truly unbreakable. Just as the goddess blessed you with her own power... I, too, received her divine protection. Long, long ago. Though different, our fates are entwined.",
        "If you experience any further changes, please know that you can rely on me to guide you. Seteth and Flayn are also here to support you however they can. Dear child... May the goddess protect you, always.",
        "As I soared through the sky... I spoke with my mother. Tell me... Is it wrong for me to be happy that I escaped death?",
        "Can you still say such things to me, even after witnessing my...other form?",
        "Thank you. Somehow I feel as though your acceptance alone is my salvation. My sweet companion... I am entrusting the future of Fódlan to you. It is the only logical choice, as everyone wishes for you to be the new leader of this land.",
        "I am not qualified to continue leading the people... Though my intention was to keep the peace in Fódlan, I still propagated a false history and deceived my faithful followers. I also took advantage of my position as archbishop to further my own selfish goal of seeing my mother again. If my foolish actions had anything to do with the war, I-",
        "I wonder... After all I have done...is it truly acceptable for me to go on living my life? You are aware that it is my fault your fate has been so cruel, are you not? You have become so strong... You and I...we were brought together by the flow of time, and bound by the hands of fate. I took you on as a professor, and ever since... Well, I believe with all of my heart that this outcome was meant to be. Oh... Perhaps it is disrespectful of me to say that.",
        "Because it gives all of the credit to time and to fate, and doesn't pay you due honor for all of the choices you made that brought us to this moment. For all that you have done... For all the joy that you have brought me... Thank you. Ever since the tragedy at the Red Canyon, I have lived a solitary life. In an effort to fill the hole left by that solitude, I took up the challenge of reviving the progenitor god... I wished for you to become the progenitor god... I wished desperately to be held in my mother's arms once more... But that has changed. Now, I wish only for you to be yourself...and to have you by my side. I love you. Dearly. And so, I must ask... Will you accept this ring? If you feel the same, I would like nothing more than to spend the rest of my life with you.",
        "You...you brought a ring as well? For me? I am overcome with joy... I never thought I would know a day so blissful as this... That we found each other... Perhaps that means my mother is looking after us. Guiding us.",
        "'''As the new leader of Fódlan, if you wish for this time of peace to be everlasting... Well, then I will happily dedicate my life to supporting your reign. No matter what obstacles we should encounter, I believe that our bond - no, rather our love - I believe that our love can overcome all. Together, we can achieve anything. With our love, we will make Fódlan's future as bright as the stars in the sky.'''",

        "Ah. There you are. I apologize for calling you in so suddenly. Please, sit. There is a matter I would like to discuss with you. I believe I've told you this before, but it is my responsibility to aid the archbishop in all her duties.",
        "Spiritual instruction, ceremony oversight, donation management—all of the church's many administrative tasks. I oversee not only the priesthood, but also the Knights of Seiros and the Officers Academy. The archbishop entrusts a great deal to my discretion, and I am honored by her confidence. Even when she must make decisions herself, she often seeks my counsel in advance. And yet... Your appointment to a teaching position at the Officers Academy was a complete surprise to me. Not only that, but you have also been entrusted with the Sword of the Creator. Frankly, that decision baffles me. You should be fully investigated, at a minimum, before being trusted with such a responsibility. But no such investigation has been conducted. I know you are skilled in war, and in matters of strategy, but beyond that I know next to nothing about you.",
        "That is indeed what it comes down to, if I'm being honest. Please understand that I mean no offense. Not only that, but you have also been entrusted with the Sword of the Creator. I was as surprised as anyone else to learn that. Frankly, I am just not sure how to handle you. I am the archbishop's right hand, and yet when it comes to you, I have been told almost nothing.",
        "And now—well, I will spare you my conjecture. In any case, it is time I learned more about you. I ask only that you answer my questions honestly. I will be most grateful for your cooperation.",
        "First, I would like to know just how much you know about yourself. You are the child of Jeralt Eisner, correct?",
        "That's quite a vague reply for such a basic question. In the future, I would advise you to answer such queries with confidence.",
        "As the former captain of the Knights of Seiros, Jeralt is renowned throughout Fódlan.",
        "If you really are his child, then no one would voice any complaint about you joining the knights. How long has it been since you became a mercenary?",

        "Your face says it all. You truly don't know, do you? Just what was Jeralt thinking raising you this way?

        "So, only one more question matters: are you ready?",
        "The truth. All of it. Learning it will doubtlessly have direct consequences on your life. I do not know what those will be. You may decide, once you learn it, that you wish you hadn't. But even if you have such regrets, you will never be able to return to ignorance. So, are you ready to know the truth?",

        "If you are still uncertain about your feelings... Then permit me to add one more thing. You, Rhea, and I... We are like family. Because of those deep ties, you can be certain that I will never abandon or betray you. On the contrary, I greatly wish to see what your future holds. I am, and will always be, your ally.",
        "You're not wrong. History is full of examples. I don't believe that will be the case here but I suppose all I can do is ask for your trust. The truth is, you have become indispensable to me. And that is true quite independently of whether I see eye to eye with Rhea, or even whether we are friends. After this war is over, where I go and what I do will depend wholly on you.",
        "I am still trying to figure that out, myself. Perhaps it is just that I find you so fascinating that I cannot bring myself to leave your side. I dislike a one-sided conversation, but in this case, I am afraid I had no choice. Our future is yours to determine.",

Because of those deep ties, you can be certain that I will never abandon or betray you. On the contrary, I greatly wish to see what your future holds. I am, and will always be, your ally.",
        "You're not wrong. History is full of examples. I don't believe that will be the case here but I suppose all I can do is ask for your trust. The truth is, you have become indispensable to me. And that is true quite independently of whether I see eye to eye with Rhea, or even whether we are friends. After this war is over, where I go and what I do will depend wholly on you.",
        "I am still trying to figure that out, myself. Perhaps it is just that I find you so fascinating that I cannot bring myself to leave your side. I dislike a one-sided conversation, but in this case, I am afraid I had no choice. Our future is yours to determine.",
        "You must be exhausted. It seems like our work has only increased since the war's end, doesn't it?",
        "I am afraid that will not do, Archbishop. We are in the process of forging a new age. As the heir to the power of Sothis, it is your duty to lead the people of Fódlan. Rhea has entrusted the Church of Seiros to you. You must have agreed to that, yes?",
        "I am sworn to help you as best I can. That sometimes requires brutal honesty. Believe me, I am just as overburdened as you. But I will not abandon this. Where you go, I follow.",
        "Yes. For whatever centuries may yet be ours, I will always remain by your side. That is why... I hope that you will accept this. '''' I will just come out with it. I love you, deeply. Will you marry me?",
        "Since I have already tied my fate to yours, I could not help but imagine how lovely it would be to exchange wedding vows with you. But there is one thing I want to make sure you understand beyond any doubt... I am not proposing to you out of a sense of duty, nor a desire to perpetuate our bloodline. I want this because I am in love with you. I cannot conceive of a world without you in it. If you feel the same... Will you do me the honor of joining your life with mine? You will?",
        "However, we must always remember our duty to the people. Even if it is at the expense of our happiness. We should wait to announce our marriage until Fódlan's stability is restored. And, with the thought of that day in mind, we must now return to our work.",
        "There are people waiting outside your office. Courage, my love! Let us go forth and face the world...together.",
        "Hmm...",
        "That phrase doesn't quite work, does it? Let's see about an alternative...",
        "No, that's bound to introduce misunderstanding. Precision is the key.",
        "But I mustn't over-complicate things either. Parting words ought to be precise.",
        "Come now. Do you really think I would resign?",
        "If you don't wish to be heard talking to yourself, then you should not speak so loudly. I'm sorry to hear that you find me intimidating.",
        "Wait. Bernadetta! Ah, typical behavior for the girl. Most concerning. Can she really go through life this way?",
        "Yes? What is it?",
        "It is nothing I haven't heard before. I am well aware of my austere nature, and I am accustomed to the commentary it brings. I do confess, however, that I was slightly hurt to see you flee from me in such abject terror.",
        "Ah—that. No, actually. I was composing a fable centered around Saint Indech.",
        "Saint Indech, one of the Four Saints. He was an extraordinarily shy person. It is said that he spent most of his life in solitude, unable to open his heart to anyone.",
        "He was, after all, a man who hid himself away at the bottom of a lake.",
        "Hm? Nothing. Now, something else to know about Saint Indech is that he had incredible skill with his hands. And that skill made him beloved by the people, because he constantly applied it to their benefit. The moral of the story is that shortcomings can be made up for with talent and kindness.",
        "Don't be so quick to dismiss your abilities. You and he are actually alike in more ways than one. You possess Indech's Crest, after all, do you not?",
        "Absolutely. Indech's...example is something that we can all learn from.",
        "Impressive. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Hm, what's this sticking out between the pages? Is this an illustration?",
        "Are you certain this was accidental? It quite fits the descriptions in this chapter. Ah, I see. You included an illustration where you thought the visual would be helpful.",
        "It really is a lovely drawing, you know. Now that I've seen it, the book would feel incomplete without it. But who is this man next to Saint Indech? I can't help but notice he bears a resemblance to me.",
        "I have to say, I never would have expected to be a reference model for Saint Cichol. What a curious ambivalence...",
        "No, what I meant to say is that I am both flattered and a little embarrassed to be portrayed in this way. Perhaps it is because, in my study of him, I feel like I've also become a friend to Saint Indech. Records show that Saint Indech and Saint Cichol worked together to achieve great things. If possible, I would like it if the two of us could similarly combine our efforts.",
        "We each bear their respective Crests, do we not? One might also say that, just as I am this book's author, you are now its illustrator. So, why don't you do some more illustrations? And color them as well. We'll add them to the book.",
        "Ah, Bernadetta. Have you finished your illustrations?",
        "Let's...leave the topic of burning aside for now, shall we? Show me what you've done.",
        "This is excellent work. The color, especially. It truly brings your art to life. I will see that the new edition of our book is added to the Garreg Mach collection.",
        "You certainly do have some impressive mood swings. Actually, there is one thing I'd like to discuss.",
        "Relax. I simply wanted to ask you about this last image. This is you, here, is it not?",
        "Nothing at all. I'm only curious. Does that make me the person standing beside you?",
        "Is that so? Then I must ask—what relationship are you suggesting you have with him?",
        "Ah, so that's why! Hahaha! That's amusing!",
        "Very much. And I think this is a very fitting end to the book, actually. Saint Cichol and Bernadetta. They would have made quite an interesting pair, I think. In fact, if the two of you had lived in the same time, I am certain you would share a deep bond.",
        "Haha! Absolutely.",
        "Finally noticed me, I see. Good to see that you are so dedicated to your training.",
        "No, this is not a military matter. I would like to discuss the distance you seem to be keeping from the others.",
        "I have noticed that you like to keep other at arm's length. And in most cases, quite a bit further.",
        "Is that why you train alone? Because your friends do not share your values?",
        "That's not exactly how I would phrase it, but having good relationships with your allies is essential in combat. I am sure you realize that it is easier to bond with people when you interact with them more. There are limits to what one person can do alone. Great things cannot be achieved without allies.",
        "To put it simply, yes. As much as you possibly can. To be honest, I envy you. Because I know what it is like to not have many people to call friends.",
        "I am talking about friends. People to speak with on equal terms. You have many friends here. You should take care to attend to them.",
        "Ah, to be young.",
        "Hello, Felix. Training alone again, I see.",
        "It is not my intention to spy. I am merely concerned about you. I do not think you have been keeping your friends at a distance because you dislike them personally. Rather, I think what bothers you is their concept of proper knighthood. Is that not so?",
        "Do you feel that way because of what happened in the Tragedy of Duscur? I have heard the story. Your brother was one of the royal knights. He gave his life to defend the prince.",
        "Not at all. I am not a knight, so I have intentions of lecturing you about chivalry. So long as one's conduct is consistent with the teachings of the goddess, it is up to the individual to decide right from wrong.",
        "You require no such pardon. This is merely advice from an old man to a younger one. As unwavering as your convictions may be, the others also feel strongly about their beliefs. If you hate all those whose beliefs are different from yours, you will hate everyone eventually. People with exactly the same beliefs as you simply do not exist.",
        "You do not have to change your beliefs, of course. But you do have to accept that others feel differently. That is my advice to you. I will speak no more of it.",
        "Because I trust you. Now that I have heard what you have to say, I trust you even more. I am also a rather eccentric person. I thought you and I might get along.",
        "Good. Do not take this the wrong way, but I hope you will surpass my expectations.",
        "Is something bothering you, Ingrid?",
        "Perhaps I can help, if you would like to share.",
        "I will not pry, of course. But if you keep it to yourself, no one will be able to help you.",
        "Count Galatea? I have met him, once or twice.",
        "Ah, I see. And the other house would benefit from the addition of your Crest-bearing blood.",
        "Ah, I see. And the other house would benefit from the addition of your Crest-bearing blood.",
        "It seems to me you have suffered much for the misfortune of being born with a Crest.",
        "I know Crests are highly valued, but they are also a burden. My feelings are mixed.",
        "Perhaps one day I will expound upon my opinion of Crests in greater detail with you. For now, let it suffice to say that whether or not you bear one is secondary to your identity. You are a person, first and foremost. And you should be permitted to grow as a person, Crest or not.",
        "If you ever wish to discuss this again, consider me available whenever you please.",
        "Ingrid. Are you familiar with the story of the King of Liberation, and the 10 Elites of Fódlan?",
        "Yes. The 10 Elites certainly possessed great power. But does that make them worthy of worship?",
        "Precisely. Initially, Nemesis and the 10 Elites worked together to bring peace to Fódlan. But soon their ambitions got the best of them, and they clashed, using their sacred weapons on anyone they chose, strong and weak alike. What I mean to say is, possessing strength alone does not make one worthy of respect. Rather, one should be judged by how they choose to use that strength.",
        "If you follow that logic, then you will see it also applies to those who are born with Crests. Now, think of how your father wishes to wed you to another family's fortune on the basis of your Crest.",
        "These are purely inherited qualities. Is it not foolish to judge a person's value by some inherited fortune? That is all a Crest is, really.",
        "I understand that Count Galatea believes he has the right to manage your affairs. I am certain he has his own share of problems. And I do not wish to meddle or lay blame. But if there is anything I should like to say to his daughter, it is this. How you live your life is up to you.",
        "Still contemplating, I see.",
        "On the contrary, you have given this honest and sincere thought. I am quite impressed, actually.",
        "Worry about the future is not unique to youth. It is human nature. At the risk of being overbearing, might I offer you one more piece of advice?",
        "Have you considered what your life would be like had you not been born with a Crest?",
        "Do you suppose that you would have been ordinary? Insignificant? I do not think so. Even without a Crest, such a promising young lady as yourself would have a bright future ahead of her.",
        "I am not typically inclined to flattery, so I hope you will take my words to heart. Have faith in yourself. If you trade that faith for a misplaced pride in your Crest, I will have to reassess your character.",
        "I am glad to hear it, Ingrid.",
        "Certainly. Have you arrived at a decision about what you would like your future to be?",
        "I am flattered. Please proceed.",
        "If that is the decision you have reached after such careful deliberation, then I have no objections. But may I ask you something?",
        "Have you actually had a conversation with your father about this?",
        "In that case, it is all the more important that you speak to him.",
        "I do not know the man well, so perhaps it is not my place to judge. However, I do know what it is like to fret constantly over one's family. If he is as doting a father as you say, then he will want to know how you truly feel. I do not think he will refuse your wishes if you share them with him honestly. Of course, if your decision remains the same after speaking with him, then so be it.",
        "That is the way! Hold your head up high, and stride forward into the unknown!",
        "Just a moment, Hilda. How are you feeling?",
        "I am glad to hear it. I had heard that you requested a substitute for your cleaning duty, due to an illness.",
        "Just prior to that, you also asked for someone to take your place with table-setting. I believe that was due to a wrist injury. It was not too serious, I hope?",
        "I seem to recall also that you declined to participate in a mock battle. That was due to a headache, yes?",
        "Indeed. It is a great friend who offers to help without complaint. See that you treasure such friends. And that you return the favor.",
        "By the way...",
        "It so happens I am on my way to the chapel to offer my prayers. Would you care to join me?",
        "Marvelous. We must always remember to give our thanks to the goddess. It is essential that we offer our prayers to her each day. That we reflect on our deeds, and strive to live as she would want us to live. For the goddess sees all that we say and do.",
        "Now, if you will excuse me.",
        "Ah—I see you are indulging in a bit of reading. You are fond of books, I take it?",
        "That is most fortuitous.",
        "Come with me. I have a story to share with you. Once upon a time, deep in the cold mountains, there lived a lazy fox and an industrious squirrel. The squirrel worked tirelessly, all day long, while the fox did nothing but lounge around and play. When autumn came, the squirrel hurriedly gathered up acorns for the winter. But the fox continued to play without a care. A biting winter fell upon the land. The mountains, caked in snow, concealed all nourishment from sight. The hungry fox went to the squirrel's dwelling, but the squirrel had locked up tight and gone to sleep. Every so often, the squirrel would wake, enjoy a nibble of an acorn, and then return to an easy slumber. The fox, on the other hand, with nowhere else to turn, was forced to scrounge for food in the bitter cold of the forest. Forlorn and hungry, he wandered in solitude all through the winter, until spring came once more. And so it is, to this very day, that foxes are denied the comforts of hibernation.",
        "That is not surprising, considering I wrote it.",
        "I did. When Flayn was young, she loved fairy tales more than anything. I would read them to her often. This one, however, is a more recent creation. I wrote it for the benefit of the children in the monastery. So, what do you think? I'm curious to hear what sort of impression it made on you.",
        "Y-you found it to be...cute?",
        "That is...not what I was hoping to hear.",
        "Hello, Hilda.",
        "Is it?",
        "Not to my knowledge. But I cannot help but notice that you no longer shy away when I speak to you.",
        "And that no longer bothers you? Does that mean your conscience is finally clear?",
        "That's unfortunate. You really should do something to correct your lazy behavior.",
        "I'm pleased to see you grasped the moral of the story.",
        "You know, that is a valid point. I have no wish to encourage that attitude in children. Perhaps if the fox only survives thanks to the squirrel kindly sharing some of his acorns. How does that sound to you?",
        "Thank you for your insight. As it happens, I have some other stories that I wrote for Flayn. Would you like to hear them?",
        "What a fine idea! I will begin immediately. Though I feel such a book requires illustrations, and I have no artistic talent. Would you lend me a hand?",
        "I could use some more of your wisdom with regard to the content of the stories also.",
        "Excellent! That's wonderful to hear! Let us produce the very best book we can, for the children's sake!",
        "Ah, Hilda. Business in town?",
        "Oh! To replenish what you used on our book, I presume? Allow me to compensate you.",
        "Wonderful to hear! We made the right choice, leaving it there.",
        "Hmm. That was not my intention. Perhaps the story was better off in its original form, after all.",
        "Originally these stories were for Flayn, but now there are lots of people who love them.",
        "I do wonder how appropriate it is to sit around and write children's books in an era of great change.",
        "Astute observation! But if I am to continue in this trade, I will require more of your assistance.",
        "I need an artist who can appreciate the message and who can draw pictures that resonate with children. Your art has a certain careless quality that I feel matches my work splendidly.",
        "Did you not purchase those art supplies today in the hopes of continuing with this work?",
        "Such lukewarm commitment—no matter. We can consider the post-war situation when we come to it.",
        "What was that?",
        "Hello, Leonie. I imagine you are here to fish?",
        "Actually, while I have enjoyed the hobby for a long while, I must admit I am less than proficient.",
        "It is likely because I am not using any bait.",
        "Truthfully, I fish only so that I might relax. It is soothing to me, to cast the line and watch the water ripple... My days are busy, even hectic. It helps to find peace and quiet every so often.",
        "Maybe so. But, to my chagrin, I do not even know what type of bait to use. I learned to fish by accompanying my wife. She was always the one to bait the hooks. She would hand me the rod, and I would cast my line. I never paid attention to how the rest was done.",
        "She passed away, quite some time ago. Since then, I have only to fish on my own. Even so, I...I find peace out here. Bait or no bait. And what about you? Why do you fish?",
        "I would certainly say so. I imagine it is intensely satisfying to catch a fish when the need is so great.",
        "Oh? Are you a skilled chef also?",
        "Impressive. Wouldn't you know it, I am suddenly overcome with the urge to excel.",
        "Indeed. Thanks to you, I now know all about the proper use of bait.",
        "I have developed a few tricks of my own as well. In my enthusiasm, I may have gotten a little greedy.",
        "Once I started to catch fish, I began to pay very close attention to the number I had caught. I hear it is not uncommon for one to become a little preoccupied with that sort of thing. And when I recalled the prospect of having what I caught cooked for me, the challenge was too tempting to ignore. But alas, it seems I have gotten a little more preoccupied than is appropriate for my age.",
        "It has made fishing an even richer experience for me. And for that, I must thank you.",
        "Oh?",
        "Seems we have both made worthwhile discoveries. So, which is it today? Hunger or relaxation?",
        "I had planned to bring all of them to you, regardless. Take as many as you please.",
        "It was. Though I did lose to you in numbers.",
        "It is a lovely specimen. The fins are rather like wings, and the scales are reminiscent of a lustrous rainbow. But I have heard this type of fish does not taste good.",
        "You truly are an expert, Leonie. I would be delighted if you would cook for us again.",
        "Entirely different style. I very much look forward to seeing what you come up with. Yet another reason to end this war swiftly.",
        "On the contrary, it is better than the usual reasons. In the heat of battle, it is little details like a friend's cooking that I reach for to find my courage.",
        "I hope there will come a time where we can fish like this, without worry, to our hearts' content.",
        "Agreed. But even after that is done, you had better not rest idle. I've grown quite fond of your cooking!",
        "Let me lend you a hand.",
        "Flayn! There you are. I've been looking everywhere for you.",
        "I think a kidnapping is good cause for concern! I was so worried about you I nearly fainted.",
        "That is a dangerous attitude. This world is full of peril. You must be more vigilant! Please understand, I allowed you to enroll here only because I thought it best for your safety.",
        "Yes, my dear little sister. You are kind beyond all measure, and you are the very picture of innocence. But, precisely because of these very fine qualities, I worry about your interactions with the others here. This year's students are... particularly eccentric. As your brother, it is my duty to help you with any concerns you may have.",
        "Even so, there must be at least some worry. Please, you need not conceal anything from me.",
        "Are you absolutely sure? The idea of you suffering in silence is unbearable to me.",
        "What is it? Tell me! I will help however I can!",
        "What?! That's horrible! Fear not, I will handle this scoundrel for you. Just tell me his name.",
        "What was Flayn getting at just now? Let's see... I was speaking to her, I asked her to share her concerns, and... Was there something else? No matter. Fear not, Flayn. Your brother will protect you from all harm!",
        "Flayn, is something the matter?",
        "I am not quite sure what you are referring to. But I promise you, I would never try to stand in your way.",
        "Well of course I have. It took me quite some time. But for you, it was well worth the effort. I was able to confirm that you are getting along well with everyone. It was very reassuring.",
        "The dining hall? Ah, I know the fellow you are referring to. Yes... I have seen the way he looks at you. I recognized in an instant that he had impure feelings for you. As your brother, I took it upon myself to test his resolve. I nearly asked him if he was prepared to lay his life on the line for my beloved sister.",
        "I am happy to see that you are making friends. But you should weigh your options more carefully.",
        "Of course I trust you. But, as an elder brother, I have a certain responsibility...",
        "Obviously.",
        "Flayn.",
        "No, I think I'm the one who ought to be pestered.",
        "That is true. No matter where you are, and no matter what you're doing, I will always worry. But that's only because I treasure you so very much. Please understand. I'm not trying to hurt you.",
        "No. The fault is entirely mine. You were still so young. I placed far too much strain on you, and our lack of resources was no excuse. Worse, I failed to watch you during the battle. Your mother too. We...lost her because of me. Afterward, it broke my heart to see how much you would need to rest just to survive. I swore that I would dedicate every moment remaining in my life to your protection.",
        "Quite right. I know you must leave the nest someday. No matter how many ages our lives may span, I know that's the way of it.",
        "Don't.",
        "I know. Please, no more. No matter what happens, you're my daughter. It gives me great joy to see you grow. But please, at least until this war is over, let me continue to worry. You're the most precious person in my life. I can't bear the thought of losing you.",
        "Thank you, Cethleann.",
        "I know you are there, Hanneman.",
        "**  Absolutely not. For 16 years, I have refused your requests. I have no intention of changing my mind.",
        "But I will lend you these documents I have found, on the condition that you stop following me.",
        "My answer is the same as every other time you have asked. I do not know. I was born a commoner, with no connections to any Crests. There are no records of my lineage.",
        "You are wasting your time. I cannot give you the answers you seek. Even if you were to discover the reason why I bear the Major Crest of Cichol, I doubt it would satisfy you.",
        "I am afraid I cannot attest to that. I am no scholar. In any case, if you really have no need for the documents, you will not mind if I dispose of them.",
        "It is a pointless endeavor. You will learn nothing from me, no matter how much you try.",
        "Persistent, aren't you? If this is about my Crest...",
        "Is that so?",
        "Very well. Go ahead.",
        "Ah... If it is an ointment you are after, I think Manuela would know more than me.",
        "What are you trying to say?",
        "The signs of age may not write themselves plainly on my face, but I feel the strain of years as much as you.",
        "Ngh...",
        "You will not pry into Flayn's business. If you interrogate her—no, if you even so much as inquire where she has been or what she has done... I will never forgive you. Never. Investigate me all you wish. I will even cooperate, if I must. But Flayn...",
        "Do I have your word on that?",
        "Using her? What do you— Oh, that is low.",
        "It seems I have no choice. To think I have been played the fool by a man of your age.",
        "Even with my cooperation, there is no guarantee you will reach the truth.",
        "Then I suppose I will have to look forward to the day you prove your claims.",
        "Manuela. A moment?",
        "I have already confirmed that you have no urgent business. I would like to hear your explanation now.",
        "Allow me to be more specific. Where were you, and what were you doing, last night?",
        "Just answer the question, please.",
        "How much you drink is not my concern. But you are an adult who is tasked with the supervision of children. You should not be causing trouble for the students. It is unacceptable for you to expose them to your disgraceful behavior. Even more so to impose upon them the labor of cleaning up your mess.",
        "From what I hear, you had to be carried.",
        "If it will help to improve your behavior, I would not object to accompanying you from now on.",
        "But first, I will lecture you on all of the intricacies of proper behavior in the supervision of children. And until I am done, you will not drink a drop of alcohol. If you agree to those conditions, I will join you. I will even drink with you. Alcohol has little effect on me.",
        "How is it that you imagine yourself the tortured one?",
        "It seems I am not the only one here. Manuela?",
        "This is quite the surprise. I would not expect to find you here outside of ordinary prayer time.",
        "There is no need to hide it. It is obvious you were praying quite solemnly just now.",
        "Interesting. I had never heard that. But I suppose, if you were only a child, this would be before I arrived at Garreg Mach. In any case, if that singing voice helped you find your way, then that is a wonderful thing.",
        "You know, when you speak of the goddess in this way, it is as though you are an entirely different person. If you were to behave that way more in your daily life, I would have a much higher opinion of you.",
        "One little compliment and you completely lose control of yourself. What am I to do with you?",
        "As thanks for the touching tale you have shared, I will satisfy your curiosity just this once. My preferred woman is kind, quiet, and proper. But above all else, she is straightforward and honest.",
        "Hello, Manuela. Is something the matter?",
        "I suppose I do typically make an effort to come here when no one else is around. Many look to me for guidance. I do not wish to disturb anyone's prayers with my own. But I did not come here only to pray.",
        "I was swearing an oath to Saint Cethleann.",
        "She is a special figure to me. It's become part of my routine to swear this oath before her likeness. More than any other, she wishes for a peaceful world. I believe it is my duty to grant her wish.",
        "I t-think you may have misunderstood me.",
        "She is very special to me, yes. But not in that way.",
        "You are completely mistaken!",
        "Manuela. About what we discussed earlier...with regard to Saint Cethleann. I feel the need to correct your misapprehensions.",
        "That's not it at all! How can I make you see... I suppose there is no other way. Allow me to tell you a very old story.",
        "I once had a wife. She passed from this world, a very long time ago.",
        "She was wise, kind of heart, and always smiling. A most wonderful woman. Not long after we married, we were blessed with a child. A girl.",
        "To protect my daughter. That has been my foremost concern, ever since I had the misfortune to lose my wife. It is my daughter who resembles Saint Cethleann. That is why I make my oath to this statue.",
        "Why is that?",
        "It is not an exact resemblance. My daughter, for instance, is neither proper nor quiet. In any case, even in matters of love, an ideal seldom lives up to reality. That is the way of the world.",
        "My wife used to say the same thing. I never quite understood what was so funny.",
        "Absolutely not. Though... No. Unthinkable.",
        "It is not a thought that has ever crossed my mind. I have been too preoccupied with fatherhood.",
        "Whatever you said just now, I didn't quite hear. But to remarry—I'd never even considered it an option until you brought it up just now. My daughter will not want to remain by my side forever. Perhaps it is time I thought about it. I suppose my daughter would not have wished for me to remain alone forever.",
        "Are we back to this again? Oh, very well. Just see that you do not drink too much. I would rather not have to carry you home.",
        "How are you, Catherine? You look well enough.",
        "That is good. I cannot help but be concerned, given your tendency toward incautious behavior. While boldness can be a virtue, I do hope you will bear in mind that recklessness is not. A moment's negligence can lead to a mortal wound for even the most skilled fighter.",
        "That is precisely the attitude that worries me. Especially given your history. You have been gravely injured before, as you no doubt recall.",
        "You mean you have forgotten? It was during your days as a student at the Officers Academy. There was an excursion—a monster hunt. You charged ahead and left your fellow students behind. You ended up alone and surrounded. You almost died. Do you truly not remember?",
        "That is true enough. But you nearly bled to death in the aftermath. The archbishop was so concerned for your life that she tended your wounds personally.",
        "That is not quite why I brought it up...",
        "I know you have a fondness for the archbishop, but do try to control yourself.",
        "That is certainly an abrupt question.",
        "Supporting the archbishop is my sole professional interest. Personally, I consider her to be something akin to a companion.",
        "Yes. As in a traveling companion. Friends who walk the same path, toward the same destination.",
        "I do not know how she feels about it.",
        "There is no need for that sort of trust. My duties are the same regardless of her perspective. I consider you to be a companion also.",
        "Certainly. Our goals are firmly aligned when it comes to that, are they not?",
        "I am pleased to hear my sentiment reciprocated. I rely on you a great deal, after all. More than most.",
        "I do not flatter. I merely want you to understand why it matters to me that you be more cautious in battle. As your companion, it is my wish for you to be safe.",
        "Ugh, no. Catherine's at it again. She has charged too far forward. I'd better join her before she—hyah!",
        "That's what I was going to ask you. How could you be so reckless?!",
        "Quite right. Thankfully, I am not badly hurt. My apologies. I didn't mean to worry you.",
        "How do you mean?",
        "Just happened to be passing through?",
        "All right. I wanted to protect you.",
        "You'd pressed much too far ahead. I feared your life might be in danger. Once that thought occurred to me, I could not stand idly by. I had to shield you from harm.",
        "I did not do this merely to assist an ally. I did it for you. I don't want to lose you.",
        "And if I am willing to risk my life to protect you, just think how much scolding I am capable of. So you had best take better care of yourself.",
        "Please do. For my sake and yours.",
        "Thank you, Cyril. Would you mind waiting just a moment for me to confirm the contents?",
        "All seems to be accounted for. I lack the time to handle tasks of this kind myself. I appreciate you making the effort. Is there anything I can assist you with? Do you have any concerns?",
        "If your better life is this frugal, I have to wonder what your previous experience was like. It must not have been easy before you came to us. But you should know that is in the past now. You are young. You should be enjoying life. Do not allow your past to overshadow that. Is there nothing you desire? We will support you in any way we can.",
        "Except?",
        "I will keep that in mind.",
        "Of course. I apologize for delaying you.",
        "Hello, Cyril. On a break?",
        "Nothing like that. I was hoping to speak with you.",
        "Yes. You told me that you are happy so long as you can continue to work for the archbishop. Have you considered that there might be other ways to find happiness?",
        "What will you do once your debt is repaid?",
        "You are possessed of a rare and admirable devotion. I, too, owe the archbishop a debt. But repaying her is only one of the reasons I am here.",
        "I mean that I have other motivations aside from that. If those motivations required me to be elsewhere, then I would be elsewhere.",
        "Yes. I am fortunate enough to share common cause with the archbishop. Thus am I able to remain. Don't be mistaken—it is admirable to repay one's debts. But that alone should not define a person. While it is good to make peace with the past, it is also essential to look ahead to the future. What kind of future do you see for yourself? What can you do to work toward it? I would like you to think about what might make your future brighter.",
        "Hmm... I do not mean to trouble you. It's just that I cannot help but notice the way you squander your potential. It's as though you avert your gaze from it on purpose. Keep what I've said in the back of your mind, at least. You have plenty of time.",
        "Cyril.",
        "You seem pensive. Have you been thinking over the advice I gave you?",
        "Scares you? Why?",
        "Betrayal is a rather strong word, don't you think?",
        "If Rhea herself felt betrayed by your actions, then yes, I suppose it would be. But if all you are doing is seeking your path, with no harm to her, I do not think she would object. In fact, I am confident she would be happy for you.",
        "Absolutely. If you continue to devote your whole life purely to repaying your debt, I think she will worry. Ask her yourself when she returns. You will see. You want to make Rhea happy, don't you?",
        "Then you should do what makes you happy.",
        "What is that?",
        "Does it perturb you to hear me speak of her with such familiarity?",
        "I am, of course, Rhea's servant. So, in a more formal context, I must maintain a deferential distance. But she and I are actually very old friends. In fact, we think of one another almost like family. I know Rhea extremely well. When I am confident about how she will feel, I am seldom wrong. So trust me when I say that if your path to happiness takes you away from here, she will wish you the best.",
        "Of course, we must first rescue her from her current predicament. I will be counting on your aid in that."

        "Hey, Professor. The students seem to like you.",
        "Still, I can't deny that you've got skills. It's a little strange, to be completely honest. I had my doubts, but they were right to make you a professor.",
        "I'll admit, it's unbelievable that you used to be a mercenary. I was a merc before coming here, but I can't imagine pulling off your fancy tactician act. I freeze up near royals and nobles.",
        "That's what I like about being a Knight. I get to punch all the nobles I want. Hah! I'm joking. But the knights do make a good business partner.",
        "I don't believe in the Church of Seiros. It makes me a bit of an anomaly among the knights. Rhea took me in, so I became a knight to repay my debt to her. I may be a knight, but it still feels like I'm doing the same things I did as a merc.",
        "Us knights are a pretty tough crew... I'm guessing you'd run circles around us though. I'm interested to see where your path leads you.",
        "Thanks for your help out there. Battles tend to go smoother with you around.",
        "It may be unwise to think this way on the battlefield... But I feel I can trust your commands without question.",
        "I've also noticed that you've been putting me in more precarious situations lately. Almost like you know I won't question your orders.",
        "** '''' I'm glad you trust me to get the job done, but still... I knew you were doing it on purpose. You're in a very important position, now that you're leader of the Imperial army. Funny to think you used to just teach at the Officers Academy. Your old students still call you \"Professor.\" That's no title for the commander of an army.",
        "You sure are an interesting one. My people lost the war and I was left to wander Fódlan alone, but I guess meeting you was my prize. You look confused. Did you not know any of this? I was living in my homeland of Dagda, up until the Imperial army destroyed it 10 years ago. But, being a mercenary, I have no real allegiance. That's why I'm working here now. Don't worry though. I don't plan to turn on you.",
        "It's been 10 years... Can I move on yet? Never mind. I know what you'd say.",
        "Another mercenary I fought alongside. They were killed ten years ago when Dagda was in conflict with the Empire. It's all I can focus on lately...",
        "To be honest, I blame you. Heh. I'm just teasing. I know it's not your fault. You just remind me of him. You give off a similar air... It's uncanny. You even have the same inflection, which makes no sense because we only ever spoke Dagdan. I don't know what it is, but you feel the same to me. I guess you just remind me of the past.",
        "It's not your fault. It's my fault for getting caught up in memories. Still, you always remember your first love, right? That's enough of that. There are more relevant topics to discuss.",
        "Your next move seems apparent... But...who knows where I'll end up. Though, I may have done enough traveling for one lifetime. I like the idea of having a permanent home. And after all my time here, I've grown quite fond of Fódlan.",
        "Sorry for making you wait. Negotiations went long.",
        "I've been considering a different kind of commitment instead. Less of a contract, more of a promise.",
        "Good. I thought you might want to follow Fódlan tradition and exchange rings. Right. That's that. Shall we be off?",
        "What's wrong? Were you expecting more? We've been fighting together for so long. No need for words. I've said enough... Right?",
        "I can see this is important to you... Fine then. I vow to stay with you through all of life's many hardships. I will stay by your side, and you'll stay by mine. I left Dagda, crossed through Brigid, and came to Fódlan on my own. I chose the life of a mercenary, alone and free to live wherever and however I pleased... Now I'm choosing to remain here, to live the rest of my life...with you. Is that enough? Now I'm just embarrassed.",
        "Look at us! We have no idea what to do with ourselves. But you're right. This is a special day. Now then. Are you ready to go?",
        "Fine. We can stay. I've already made a fool of myself. No point in trying to avoid it now. So, what else is there to talk about? Oh, right. Remember when I mentioned how much you have in common with my old partner? I don't think that's actually true. I didn't want to admit that I was attracted to you, so I convinced myself that I was just pining for the past. I was worried that revealing those feelings would ruin our friendship...",

        "What is it, Hubert?",
        "Don't worry your fragile little self. Your lady princess is safe. I wouldn't shoot my employer.",
        "I said \"lady.\" I already told you. I'm not going to break the princess's contract.",

        "You're unstable, Hubert. Be careful who you threaten. I don't take kindly to those who get in the way of my contracts.",
        "Just some advice.",
        "It's me. You owe me for that one.",
        "Same thing you are. But I'm after a particular target. The dark side of the Knights of Seiros is proving troublesome. I should have known, having been one.",
        "Save it. Just doing my job.",
        "You wouldn't, so why ask?",
        "What's it matter? I owed a debt to Rhea. I served in the Knights of Seiros to repay her. I repaid that debt. Now I'm here. I'm sure it was considered dishonorable of me to leave, but that's none of my concern. I have no connection to the Seiros faith, nor to the ways of Fódlan.",
        "You worry too much. Watch out, or it'll be the death of you.",
        "All finished. Time to go.",
        "And what if I don't? I can take you.",
        "We're allies now? I guess I should be more careful with you. Are you sure it was right to kill them? I believe your mistress told you to let them go.",
        "Is that so? Maybe you're not just some sycophant. It takes guts to disobey a direct order.",
        "Logical through and through, aren't you?",
        "I like people who are thorough.",
        "As a rule, I am. Regarding decisions, I planned on leaving Fódlan after completing my contract... But now I'm starting to think I might stay here.",
        "I have no ulterior motives. I've just grown a little fond of you.",
        "For someone so intelligent, you're very dense. It's not just about you though. I've learned to like Lady Edelgard and most everyone else here as well. I wouldn't mind staying on to work as your specialist.",
        "Fair, but you owe me, remember?",
        "It was nothing.",
        "Maybe.",
        "Maybe. No promises though.",
        "It's nothing personal. As someone born in Dagda, I'm not very fond of the Empire.",
        "That Dagda. But that is behind us.",
        "You misunderstand. I harbor no ill will toward your generation.",
        "I simply have other commitments. I don't have the time to teach everyone, so I can't make any promises.",
        "Caspar. How have you been?",
        "What's wrong?",
        "Then you should try acting like it. If something is bothering you, you should come out and say it.",
        "I'm disappointed, Caspar. I thought you were the type to always speak your mind.",
        "Yes. And?",
        "Perhaps. Your point?",
        "What does my past have to do with you?",
        "Are YOU responsible for what happened to the Dagdans?",
        "Bring them back.",
        "If you're responsible, then bring back the lives that were lost. If you can't, then spare me your pity.",
        "Yesterday's enemy is today's ally. You have to abandon old feuds. Only then can you face me as a friend.",
        "Leave this to me! Go!",
        "Caspar! Are you all right? Talk to me!",
        "Lower your voice. I'm right here.",
        "Correct. It took you a while to wake up. '''' You nearly died protecting me. Why did you do something so reckless?",
        "Is this your attempt to take responsibility for your father's actions? I don't need your pity, Caspar.",
        "You are still a fool. Learn to protect yourself before trying to protect me. There's no point in losing one life to save another. Yours holds just as much value as mine.",
        "However, I cannot deny that I owe you a debt. Thank you, Caspar. And... '''' I apologize.",
        "For when we spoke before. I... may have been too harsh. I cannot hold a grudge against someone who would risk his life for mine. That said, you need not worry about me.",
        "You fought well in that battle. You've improved.",
        "True.",
        "Fine. In the past, you were reckless. Lately, you are less so. You are more considerate of your allies, and much easier to fight alongside.",
        "I can't disagree.",
        "An interesting concept. We have become a very efficient team, but you will never understand my thoughts.",
        "Then prove it. What am I thinking right now.",
        "Wishful thinking?",
        "You did indeed.",
        "Don't worry; your wishes aren't so far from the truth. Now, shall we be off?",
        "Ah. Petra. Well, it looks like it might rain.",
        "Sure.",
        "You can tell I'm from Dagda? Ah, I suppose [[Brigid]] is our neighbor. As for why I work here, that's simple. I work to live. Rhea took me in when I had nowhere else to go. I'm here to repay my debt. I don't plan to return to Dagda any time soon.",
        "The only ones I've fought in person are the Imperial army. I carry no ill will toward anyone else.",
        "How about you? Do you hate them? The Empire is your father's enemy, no? And it's Dagda's fault that Brigid got pulled into the war at all... So, do you hate Dagda? Or do you see that as none of your concern?",
        "Makes sense. You can hate a country without hating its people.",
        "I'm not that special. I just don't let emotions get in my way.",
        "Let's hear it, Petra.",
        "Hah. I'd join the army of Dagda. I'd lay waste to Fódlan, and return to my homeland.",
        "Of course. You expect me to die for you? You should be prepared to do the same. Your homeland would likely join Dagda.",
        "Maybe...if you'd asked me five years ago.",
        "I've been a mercenary since childhood. Always fighting for a bounty. If my allies didn't pay, I'd side with the enemy. It's why I became a sniper. Easier to dispose of anyone with a reward on their head. It's also why I joined the Knights of Seiros. I owned them a debt. But that's all changed.",
        "That's right. When I see everyone fighting for Fódlan, I feel inclined to help. I won't die for the cause, but I will protect everyone. If the army of Dagda engaged you, I'd fight at your side.",
        "Ah. It's... you. What is it?",
        "Evening. Library. Front. Got it. Oh, one more thing...",
        "A bug landed on your shoulder. Sorry if I startled you.",
        "Anything else?",
        "Good.",
        "Likewise. No need to say what isn't worth saying, right?",
        "Agreed.",
        "Farewell.",
        "Dutiful as ever, Dedue.",
        "You're always busy delivering messages.",
        "Does he need you to run such trivial errands?",
        "Reason to live? Huh.",
        "Not quite. I joined the knights to repay a debt I owed [[Rhea]]. The debt's been repaid, so she's nothing more than a former employer.",
        "Not especially. I wouldn't call Rhea my \"reason to live.\"",
        "I'd consider it. That's what mercenaries do.",
        "Everyone's different. I'm not trying to criticize your loyalty. I've seen a lot of people like you all over the world. They don't tend to last very long though. Try not to end up like them.",
        "I thought I lost it in battle. Thank you. I wonder if this dagger will ever fulfill its purpose...",
        "I try to think of it as just work, but I'm still human. Was there anything else?",
        "That's not like you. Our only common ground is brevity. Now you want to chat? What's gotten into you?",
        "The feeling is mutual. Being born in Duscur, you're an outsider here in Fódlan. I've devoted myself to Fódlan, but really I'm an outsider too. So there are some things that connect us.",
        "Even so, I am not like you and never could be.",
        "That's just how people are. Even people with deep romantic or familial connections will never be identical.",
        "Hmph. At least you're easy to talk to. You could make a good partner for a mercenary like me.",
        "That depends on how much your master would pay.",
        "Enough chatting. We should prepare for battle.",
        "I'm always around.",
        "Claude. Why are you lazing about? You should be training.",
        "But I didn't. Fortunately for you.",
        "Conversation was not my intention.",
        "Look closely at the dagger.",
        "A poisonous spider. The tiniest bite from which can cause fever, headache, and relentless vomiting. Or worse.",
        "I noticed it descending towards your face.",
        "I'll keep that in mind.",
        "Hah! Heh.",
        "It's nothing to boast about. Just part of the job.",
        "Don't forget assassination and coercion. Is there someone you need killed?",
        "You went out of your way to find me. I thought you might need a favor.",
        "With me?",
        "I worked as a mercenary in Dagda. That is, until I was defeated in battle against the Empire and left for dead.",
        "I know how to conceal myself.",
        "That is true. I could return if I really wanted. But Rhea took me in and I owe her a debt. I also don't hate it here. For now, this is where I belong.",
        "I wouldn't know. You need to figure that out yourself.",
        "You're quite skilled.",
        "Is it?",
        "Don't flatter yourself.",
        "Last we spoke, you were questioning whether or not you belong here.",
        "That is true for most people. Life would be tedious if we knew what lies ahead. Whether or not you belong in a place can change at any time. As soon as you settle in somewhere new, you begin to question your decision.",
        "What are you going on about now?",
        "Is this your sad attempt at flirting? I will admit, you're an interesting one.",
        "Ah yes. The poisonous spider.",
        "I would not take a life without reason.",
        "For a nap, I'm sure.",
        "I haven't given it much thought.",
        "There is no one waiting for me there, and no reason to hurry back. Besides, I've grown accustomed to the nomadic lifestyle. I can make do wherever I find myself. Though, I may be interested in visiting Almyra.",
        "It's as far from my homeland as possible. That's reason enough for me. And you? Where will you go?",
        "Why would you do that?",
        "And do what?",
        "Heh. We can decide where we belong when we get there.",
        "Where are you going?",
        "Don't you have a question?",
        "I'm finished meditating. Speak.",
        "Always be willing to speak and ask questions. Understood?",
        "Next time?",
        "Why must he be so difficult?",
        "What is it? Do you need something?",
        "Oh.",
        "I will not.",
        "There's no point in me telling you about it.",
        "Wait. You misunderstand. Hearing me tell stories about the things I've seen... What good is that? That's just my experience. If you want to know about the world, you need to experience it for yourself...is what I meant to say.",
        "How so?",
        "Is that what you think? In your experience, do I seem to dislike you? If you can't determine something as simple as that, then you would gain nothing from the outside world.",
        "Ask me. I'm right here.",
        "Not brave enough to ask a simple question...or does he just not care?",
        "To put it plainly—no, I do not dislike you.",
        "Hm, so he does care... Why were you asking me about the world outside Fódlan before?",
        "I see. You should go.",
        "I told you before. In order to know the world, you have to experience it for yourself. There is much to see. Even simple things. Flowers. Food. Varieties that don't exist in Fódlan. New smells. New tastes. I could tell you about them... But you would only imagine them, not comprehend them. If you want true understanding, go out into the world. See it with your eyes. Feel it with your skin... Speak to its people. Then you will know.",
        "Is there something else?",
        "It's nothing.",
        "Not yet. You're ahead of me there. I must find my own path.",
        "If you have time for empty compliments, you have time to encourage me instead.",
        "Thank you, Ignatz. I'll do my best.",
        "Your mind, body, and technique are not synchronized. Find harmony between the three. You lack experience. You'll improve if you practice.",
        "I am always training. Look here.",
        "Watch.",
        "Look closely.",
        "I train everything. Eyes. Speed. Accuracy. Watch as the bird flies. Feel the wind. Recognize the distance between objects. Not all training requires a weapon. Integrate training into your daily routine.",
        "Very good. Just be cautious.",
        "I heard what you did. I'm disappointed, Leonie.",
        "You aimed your bow at a group of students passing through the monastery. Was this your idiotic idea of training? I told you to be cautious.",
        "What were you planning on doing after you took aim? Shooting passersby? Of course not. If you want to train, choose a target you can actually shoot.",
        "Nobody's happy to have a bow pointed at them.",
        "Mentor? Was that Jeralt? I don't know much about him. Would he really do that?",
        "Not a good habit to emulate. From now on, only aim at bugs. Like I showed you.",
        "You don't like bugs? That should make you want to aim at them even more.",
        "Then just draw some spiders and hang them on the walls. Aim at the drawings whenever you pass one. Overcome your fear of bugs while you train.",
        "Yes. I should know.",
        "I was, but they don't bother me anymore.",
        "And don't hang them where other people might pass.",
        "I'm choosing to believe that.",
        "You're improving, Leonie. No doubt a result of your new training routine.",
        "Something wrong?",
        "You're still aiming at the spiders I instructed you to draw? Let me see one.",
        "I— What is this?",
        "Ah, yes. I-I see no. It's quite— Well, it's— Hahaha!",
        "Haaah! Phew... I'm sorry. I lost my composure for a moment there. Your drawing is absolutely ridiculous.",
        "Do you know how many legs a spider has? Or what its body looks like? Or ever seen one at all?",
        "A lack of subtlety no doubt learned from your former mentor. Regardless, aiming at this target won't help you overcome your fears. Here, use one of my drawings instead. Consider it an apology for my outburst.",
        "This much detail is necessary if you wish to identify your enemy's weak points.",
        "This is guaranteed to help overcome your fears and improve your archery in the process.",
        "You want to be a peerless mercenary, right? You'll never accomplish that if you're afraid of something innocuous as a bug.",
        "Excellent. I look forward to seeing fewer spiders around here.",
        "Mission accomplished. Let's pack up and get out of here.",
        "What's wrong? You don't seem like your usual self.",
        "Don't try to hide it. You're making it obvious.",
        "That depends on how stupid it is.",
        "Correct. And your point?",
        "Never.",
        "After all the lives you've taken, why worry about it now?",
        "What a tiresome man.",
        "Alois.",
        "Calm down. It's just me.",
        "Your heart's in your chest. Not your head.",
        "Your reaction was excessive. Are you afraid of ghosts?",
        "Terrified? Of ghosts?",
        "I didn't mean to pry. There's no need to—",
        "You asked if I ever think about the people I've killed.",
        "I apologize for striking you, but it had to be done. Have you calmed down?",
        "I'm surprised someone like you managed to become a knight. Or perhaps that's why you became one...",
        "No need to apologize. I was not bothered.",
        "I know. In fact, you are the most loyal knight I have fought beside. You are no coward.",
        "You should not mistake your kindness for weakness. You contemplate the lives you have taken because you care, even when the emotions may be frivolous.",
        "That is something I am not capable of. I am not the only one who has noticed. Everyone else sees your kindness and wishes to share in it.",
        "It's OK to hold on to the ghosts of your past. They are part of who you are. But you cannot let them hold on to you. If you are sad, others will notice and share in that as well.",
        "He recovered quickly, and with surprising energy. Alois has many qualities I could never emulate. His positive and kind nature gives strength to those around him. Even to this Dagdan mercenary trying to find her place in an unfamiliar land...",
        "Then again, he has many qualities that I do not wish to emulate.",
        "Sure.",
        "Do I need to be?",
        "Now that's funny. I remember thinking you were just another knight who loved the sound of her own voice. You know, the type who's all talk, but useless in battle.",
        "Yes.",
        "I did. You're surprisingly strong.",
        "It sounds like I'm going to be doing a lot more work around here.",
        "If that's how you see it, I can't disagree.",
        "That battle was a decent challenge, but when push came to shove, they didn't have a chance.",
        "You must really love worshiping the church. Or is it just Rhea?",
        "I don't get the Seiros religion. Or Rhea.",
        "She did, and that's why I fight for her. Doesn't mean I worship her.",
        "You're the stubborn one. When we're on missions related to Rhea, it's like you're wearing blinders. Now that she's been rescued, your carelessness is probably just going to get you killed. Wanting to help her is admirable, but you'll be of no use if you get yourself killed.",
        "That's not what I meant.",
        "Fine. But I want you to know something... It's not easy to put your life in the hands of someone who doesn't share your beliefs.",
        "We don't need to have this conversation.",
        "Something about our vastly different approaches to life.",
        "Really I—",
        "I was gonna say I'd hear you out.",
        "Between you and Rhea, I'd choose you. But between you and me, I'd choose me. That probably disqualifies me from being your partner too.",
        "Huh.",
        "Nothing. You're not like the rest of the knights.",
        "Heh. It is a possibility.",
        "We can worry about it when the time comes... But until our paths diverge, you're my partner. And I couldn't ask for a better one.",
        "I was just on a mission. What's gotten into you?",
        "About our paths diverging.",
        "The terrible \"Thunder Catherine,\" afraid? I thought you weren't afraid of anything.",
        "You seem very passionate about this.",
        "I see... Catherine, I have to tell you something. I...lost my first partner. Which is why I can make no guarantees that this will last forever. But I want you to know there's no one I would rather have at my side. I could never sever my bond with you. If there ever comes a day when our paths do diverge, know that I'll always be with you.",
        "Of course... But that's enough of that. I can't stand any more of your vulnerable side.",
        "No need to apologize. It's what partners are for. If you'd like, we can start planning our next move.",
        "We can wed if you're that worried about losing me. Though, I may tire of your company. You look a bit red. What's the matter, partner?",
        "You were fine.",
        "You take too many direct shots though.",
        "Of course it is. But if you can hit your enemy with a straight shot, you're too close. Tell me, Cyril. What's an archer's greatest weakness?",
        "Exactly. As an archer, your position is critical. Know exactly how far the enemy is and keep a minimum safe distance. Understood?",
        "So you understand why you can't rely on straight shots. You have to use curved shots as well. Never run up to your target. Hit them from a safe range. Shoot 'em from a safe range with curved shots. Archers should always control the battlefield.",
        "You're not a bad student. If nothing else, you have the right attitude.",
        "Keep it up.",
        "You did well. You maintained a safe distance.",
        "Is that worth celebrating?",
        "I give praise where it's due. To that point, you've made incredible progress. At first you couldn't even draw a bow.",
        "Hah! Really?",
        "Maybe I was testing you. Seeing if you'd give up. You're the one who insisted that I teach you archery. I never intended to take you on as my student.",
        "I gain nothing personally, but the whole army benefits if you're skilled.",
        "Listen carefully, Cyril. This is important. Are you interested in becoming a better archer?",
        "Good. Then you need to find another teacher.",
        "Because I said so.",
        "Not at all.",
        "I simply have nothing left to teach you.",
        "It is. Your fighting style is fundamentally different from mine. I'm a sniper. I find a secluded spot on the battlefield and pick my enemies off one by one. But you, you're a harrier. You weave in and out of the battlefield, assailing the enemy with rapid fire.",
        "Correct. And your progress has revealed where your strengths lie. I've taught you as much as I can. You'll have to find a teacher who specializes in your tactics if you wish to grow.",
        "Then you'll never improve.",
        "OK, Cyril. Let's forget this conversation ever happened. And...thank you. Now stop standing around. We have work to do."

        "I fell for that girl recently, but I just wanted to have some fun and leave it at that. So I told her we should break it off. I guess she was feeling a little more serious than I was. She started crying, and everything got a bit...complicated.",
        "Come on, Professor. Playing around with girls is the most fun a guy can have. Besides, I don't care what you think of me. I don't intend to change how I live my life. I'm a good-for-nothing, if you haven't noticed, but I'm still a noble with a Crest. That's all anyone cares about. It's best to avoid getting too serious with fools like that. It only leads to trouble. I'm gonna be forced into an arranged marriage with some random noble woman anyway. By the way, Professor. You didn't know you had a Crest, did you?",
        "I see. I suppose a mercenary wouldn't be concerned with such things.",
        "Most children who are born to noble families are tested upon birth to see if they bear one. Even descendants of the 10 Elites, like myself, can't be legitimate heirs without a Crest. That means, as children, we're only accepted if we're born with one. The heads of most noble houses keep having kids until they get one with a Crest. Those children grow up to be heads of their houses, and the vicious cycle continues. Do you get it now? To all these commoner girls, I'm just a trophy. Or rather, a studhorse.",
        "If I marry a girl and she gives birth to a child with a Crest, that kid might become the next head of House Gautier. But nowadays, with the bloodlines getting weaker, there are a lot of kids like [[Miklan|my brother]]...born with no hope. For ages now, those of us with Crests have been envied and desired but never for who we are. I understand the value of my blood. Believe me, I hate how much I understand it. I know better than to dream of being free from this burden, I'm used to it by now. I used to think I didn't have the right to live freely.",
        "Heh heh... That's right. You know what? I'm a bit jealous. The whole time you were growing up, you never knew you had a Crest. You were free. Nobody pretended to like you. I kind of hate you for that... You were a spoiled brat who should pay for that Crest. Maybe I'll collect the debt. Ha! Gotcha! Wow, you shoulda seen the look on your face just then. don't mind me, Professor. After all, ladies love a dark and brooding noble.",
        "Ugh, that hurts... Ah, Professor! Thanks for stopping by.",
        "It's not bad. I was even told I'd be cleared for service starting tomorrow. Besides, I got this scar fighting for you. It's almost like a medal or something.",
        "When I thought you were going to be killed for real, my reflexes kicked in. I reacted without thinking. It doesn't mean I've stopped being jealous of you. But, come on, I can't help looking up to you. If I'd had the guts to run away from home, I wonder if I would have cared as little about my Crest as you do yours...",
        "No... But if I thought I could have escaped, I would have tried. I'd leave behind House Gautier and the life of a nobleman...and anybody who knew I had a Crest. Our home is to the very north of the Kingdom. Just across the mountains from us is land inhabited by foreigners to [[Fódlan]]. It once belonged to [[Holy Kingdom of Faerghus|Faerghus]], but now that the Kingdom has collapsed, it's only a matter of time until fighting breaks out. Anyway, that land has been contested for centuries, and all that time, it has fallen to House Gautier to protect it. Actually, our Lance of Ruin has been doing most of the protecting.",
        "Those were dangerous times. One wrong step and we would have lost our Relic to the church. My father was afraid that the church would try to keep the lance, so he entrusted it to me. If an emergency arose, I was supposed to be called back home. I guess those very situations are why my family values Crests so much. Since I bear a Crest, my parents made sure I was never left wanting. My older brother didn't have one, and so when I was born, he was pushed aside. You know he once shoved me in a well? He left me on the mountainside in the middle of winter too.",
        "Even as a little kid, I understood why he was like that. My mere existence stole everything from him. I have no right to complain when I am surrounded by people who would give anything to bear a Crest but do not. Now women smile at me for the same reason my parents adored me...and my brother wanted me dead. And I have to meet them all with a smile and a wink because I have a Crest.",
        "Anyway, it was pretty unreasonable of me to resent you. I'm really sorry about that. And I want to say thank you, Professor. Seriously. Thank you.",

That means, as children, we're only accepted if we're born with one. The heads of most noble houses keep having kids until they get one with a Crest. Those children grow up to be heads of their houses, and the vicious cycle continues. Do you get it now? To all these commoner girls, I'm just a trophy. Or rather, a studhorse.",
        "If I marry a girl and she gives birth to a child with a Crest, that kid might become the next head of House Gautier. But nowadays, with the bloodlines getting weaker, there are a lot of kids like my brother...born with no hope. For ages now, those of us with Crests have been envied and desired but never for who we are. I understand the value of my blood. Believe me, I hate how much I understand it. I know better than to dream of being free from this burden, I'm used to it by now. I used to think I didn't have the right to live freely.",
        "Heh heh... That's right. You know what? I'm a bit jealous. The whole time you were growing up, you never knew you had a Crest. You were free. Nobody pretended to like you. I kind of hate you for that... You were a spoiled brat who should pay for that Crest. Maybe I'll collect the debt. Ha! Gotcha! Wow, you shoulda seen the look on your face just then. don't mind me, Professor. After all, ladies love a dark and brooding noble.",
        "Ugh, that hurts... Ah, Professor! Thanks for stopping by.",
        "It's not bad. I was even told I'd be cleared for service starting tomorrow. Besides, I got this scar fighting for you. It's almost like a medal or something.",
        "When I thought you were going to be killed for real, my reflexes kicked in. I reacted without thinking. It doesn't mean I've stopped being jealous of you. But, come on, I can't help looking up to you. If I'd had the guts to run away from home, I wonder if I would have cared as little about my Crest as you do yours...",
        "No... But if I thought I could have escaped, I would have tried. I'd leave behind House Gautier and the life of a nobleman...and anybody who knew I had a Crest. Our home is to the very north of the Kingdom. Just across the mountains from us is land inhabited by foreigners to Fódlan. It once belonged to Faerghus, but now that the Kingdom has collapsed, it's only a matter of time until fighting breaks out. Anyway, that land has been contested for centuries, and all that time, it has fallen to House Gautier to protect it. Actually, our Lance of Ruin has been doing most of the protecting.",
        "Those were dangerous times. One wrong step and we would have lost our Relic to the church. My father was afraid that the church would try to keep the lance, so he entrusted it to me. If an emergency arose, I was supposed to be called back home. I guess those very situations are why my family values Crests so much. Since I bear a Crest, my parents made sure I was never left wanting. My older brother didn't have one, and so when I was born, he was pushed aside. You know he once shoved me in a well? He left me on the mountainside in the middle of winter too.",
        "Even as a little kid, I understood why he was like that. My mere existence stole everything from him. I have no right to complain when I am surrounded by people who would give anything to bear a Crest but do not. Now women smile at me for the same reason my parents adored me...and my brother wanted me dead. And I have to meet them all with a smile and a wink because I have a Crest.",
        "Anyway, it was pretty unreasonable of me to resent you. I'm really sorry about that. And I want to say thank you, Professor. Seriously. Thank you.",
        "Before I met you, I'd gone my whole life not knowing there was another way for me to live. So from the bottom of my heart...I'm glad we met.",
        "Professor, I've been waiting for you awhile. I've just been out here watching the sky grow lighter.",
        "It's really just hitting me. For the past five years we've been fighting and fighting... But now the war's over. It's time for a new way of life. So I've decided I want to take responsibility for my own fate.",
        "That's right. My Crest doesn't decide my fate. I do. It's time for the first step in the right direction. I don't want to marry a girl who wants to use me for my Crest or a girl who someone else chose for me. I want to marry someone I really care about. And, you know, maybe I can't...but I'd like to try.",
        "You don't believe me? I probably should have seen that coming... In that case, I'll just have to propose to you over and over again...until you know I'm serious. Marry me. I'd do anything for you. I'm done lying, especially to myself.",
        "You mean... If we're together, I don't even care if I stay locked up inside for the rest of my life. If you told me you didn't want me to look at another woman, I'd go blind for you.",
        "Sorry about that. I got a little excited. I've spent my whole life relying on flowery language, so it's a bit hard to rein it in. OK... Calming down now. I'm just over the moon about this. With you by my side, I'm excited to find out what this new way of life is all about. We fought hard for today, and I'm beyond happy just to be alive. And now, I'm engaged to the perfect woman. Strike that. You know what? My happiness isn't what I care about today.",
        "I'd better avoid the training grounds. I swear, His Highness never sleeps...",
        "Ah, Your Highness! Hello. No, I was not wildly carousing with women. There was only the one. Let's just forget you saw me, agreed?",
        "OK, I get it. I don't need one of your lectures. I've got them all memorized anyway. I promise I'll be better in the future. I'll stop going out at night. I'll focus more on my studies... And in return, you'll go into town with me, and we'll invite some cute girls to dinner. Shall we shake on it?",
        "You need to get out more. Naive and uptight is no way to live your life.",
        "I'm not so sure. Most men are experienced enough to know not to give a dagger to the girl they—",
        "With your brute strength, a knock on the head could knock the life right out of me. You'd better watch that temper, Your Highness. So how about this—I'll try to behave, and you'll try to loosen up?",
        "What'd I just say? Of course I'll behave. A knight of Faerghus never goes back on his word. What about you? I wanna see you with a girl on your arm.",
        "Seriously?! Ha! Yeah, I'll believe it when he introduces me to the lucky girl. Oh, Dimitri. You always take even the silliest things so very seriously. This should be fun...",
        "Uh...Your Highness? Why are you in my room?",
        "**'''' Hide? From who?",
        "I'm sorry... It's a what?",
        "You didn't give her a dagger, did you? Is that why you're hiding? Does she have a dagger, Dimitri?",
        "You invited a girl to dinner, and now she's chasing you around. What's the big deal? Unless... Did you use one of my pick-up lines? Those words are dangerous in the wrong hands. With me, people know a line's a line and I'm joking. But you... Nobody's ever accused you of being funny.",
        "Relax, Your Highness. Relax. I'll sort this whole thing out, real easy. All we have to do is figure out how to make this girl lose interest in you. And making girls lose interest is what I'm best at! You just wait right there, and I'll fix everything.",
        "This is no job for an amateur. You need a professional's help. Trying to do everything yourself has never served you so well, so just leave this to the master. Even the dagger incident could have been avoided if you had just talked with me beforehand.",
        "Whatever you say. The point is you need to learn to rely on me for these types of things in future. For now, I got this. And if I ever need help with... something you know how to help with, then maybe you can do the same for me.",
        "Please, Your Highness. I've spent years honing my skills for just this situation. Watch and learn.",
        "Dedue, hey. Oh! I'm sorry. I hope I'm not bothering you. Looks like you're pretty deep in thought.",
        "I just wanted to stop by and ask... It was your turn to cook last night, yeah?",
        "Well, it was great. I was wondering if you could give me some tips. You know, teach me how to cook. I hear a girl loves a man who can cook.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh, please. I don't care who misunderstands what about me. I talk to who I want. Besides, I believe the Duscur people are innocent.",
        "Faerghus and Duscur have been friendly since, heck, forever. So why would our old friends from Duscur just up and assassinate our king? It doesn't make sense. Sure, there are probably folks from Duscur who don't like Faerghus. But do I think there's enough of 'em to mount an attack and slaughter the king and his whole company of elite guards?",
        "Right? At most, I can see a misguided group of people from Duscur conspiring with someone else who had plans to dethrone the king. Maybe they were even lured into participating and used as scapegoats. Regardless, it doesn't concern you or the rest of your people. A person can't be judged by the worst of their kind... Or else where would any of us be? Besides, people like to talk about me anyway. So let them talk.",
        "OK... You're making a weird face. What did I say?",
        "Heh heh... Well, I'm glad I've cleared up that misunderstanding. But really, there's no way I'm the only person who figured all that out. There must be people who think like me in Fhirdiad, including His Highness.",
        "Once a misunderstanding takes hold, it isn't easy to clear the air, not without solid evidence of the truth. But even if we found evidence that your people are innocent, those negative sentiments wouldn't disappear overnight. The only thing that can change that is time and effort. Depressing isn't it?",
        "Man, that got serious. Shouldn't we lighten things up with a nice cooking lesson?",
        "Ah, this is delicious. I can't believe I made it!",
        "What's the matter? Have I got something on my face?",
        "Oh yeah? Which ones? Is it that I'm terrible to girls? Or the rumor where I bring some terrible misfortune to the girls I date? I don't, by the way. In case you're about to ask. Oh! I also heard about how I'm total trash and everyone should avoid me. That might be my favorite.",
        "The way I figure it, if I can't be respected, I can at least be well-informed.",
        "Indefensibly? Heh, that's a bit harsh.",
        "Well, thank you all the same. Listen. You don't need to worry what people think about me. As you well know, it's not easy to correct misunderstandings or change people's minds. And if I'm going to behave so badly, it seems misunderstandings are inevitable.",
        "I appreciate that, Dedue. You think the world will ever see us that way?",
        "I can't tell if you're joking or not. But I like it.",
        "Hey, Felix, you free? You don't look very busy. Let's go find some girls to chat with.",
        "Hey, come on. Don't talk like that. How long have we known each other?",
        "Is that how it went? Huh. I remember it more like you always following me around. Whenever there was something wrong—like you lost to your brother or you fought with Dimitri—you'd come crying to me. You were so meek and pure back then, cute even... like a baby brother.",
        "What?",
        "Hey! Sorry. I just came to see if you wanted to pick up some girls. I didn't mean to get on your nerves.",
        "Well, if a man sees a pretty girl, he can't just let her pass by without commenting. That's just rude.",
        "That's never my intention. Come on, you know me better than that. I'm not really— Look, if that's the impression I've given you, then I'm sorry.",
        "The other day? What are you talking about, Felix? Is this a trap?",
        "Oh, that? Can't say it didn't hurt, but you have nothing to apologize for. I mean, you've said worse, Felix. Considerably worse. Come on, we've known each other since we were kids. We're not going to let your constant verbal abuse get in the way of our friendship, are we?",
        "Whenever I started doing something dumb, you'd yell at me about it.",
        "All these years and not much has changed, has it? {{Abbr|Even if we don't have Ingrid lording over us.|Only said if Sylvain and Felix were both recruited to another house, but Ingrid wasn't.}} But you're different, Felix. You used to be so, I don't know... carefree when we were young. Now you're the exact opposite.",
        "Again with the abuse! This from the guy who's always been by that good-for-nothing's side. So did you come to apologize or to insult me?",
        "You're off to train? Again? Now who's insatiable?",
        "A little idleness would do you some good, pal. Come on. Let me buy you something to eat.",
        "You have to choose, Felix. Our friendship, or your training.",
        "What did—is he—Wait, Felix! I'll come train too. Wait up!",
        "What are \"these\", Felix? Oh, hey, is this candy?",
        "Right, you don't like sweet stuff. Thanks, I'll eat them later. So, what do you need? Want me to help you get closer to a girl? Just point her out.",
        "Nah, I didn't do anything special. Friends help each other out, especially on the battlefield. Just a little give and take, ya know?",
        "Nope. I try to stay on an even keel.",
        "Always what?",
        "Come on. If you've got something on your mind, then say it.",
        "Fair enough. I'll be having something to eat while you're deciding...whatever it is you're deciding. Actually, come with me. My treat. If you do want to talk, then I'm right there.",
        "Free food, possible conversation, and when we're done, we can find some girls.",
        "It was a joke! Felix, I was joking! Come on, let's just go eat.",
        "'''' Hey, Felix. I'm glad you're safe.",
        "Look, it doesn't matter, as long as you're safe. You can go on living, while I...",
        "Heh heh... Nah, I won't die on you. I promise. You think something like this could kill me? No way. A little magic will take care of the wound. Some bed rest then I'm good to go out and do it all over again.",
        "Oh, come on. That was funny. It's not like you to be so concerned.",
        "Hey! That's not nice! You should be thanking me.",
        "A hug? Did you get hit on the head? Come on. Tell me you want to hug me again. I liked it.",
        "You know how we grew up together?",
        "Do you remember the promise we made when we were kids? About sticking together until we die together?",
        "Well, I'm really not trying to get myself killed before you. You know that, right?",
        "OK, I get it. Once I've healed, I'll get my act together.",
        "That's what friends are for, Felix.",
        "Wow, Ashe. Training again? You're taking this whole knight thing pretty seriously.",
        "No choice? I think you're making life too difficult. Knights don't have to be perfect. All I'm saying is I've seen some pretty sloppy knights out there.",
        "Virtuous and gallant? Are you kidding me? If you just ride around being virtuous, people will get fed up. They'll boot you out of town.",
        "Interesting idea. You think very highly of this whole virtue thing. Say, have there been any knights who became great just by thinking highly of themselves? Think on this—knights are supposed to protect people and earn their admiration. Isn't that right?",
        "Seize people's hearts!",
        "You want people to love you? Offer them something they haven't got. Guess what that is? It's you, Ashe. They don't have you! Get out there, buddy. Be valiant. Help people. Here. I'll show you how it works.",
        "Hey there, cutie! You seem to have lots of bags there. They must be heavy. My name's Sylvain. Let me help you out. Are these going to the warehouse?",
        "No thanks necessary! It's been enough just to be able to talk to you. Well, if you insist, how about we go get some tea? It must be fate that we met like this... I'd like to get to know you.",
        "What's up, Ashe? Looking for more life tips?",
        "That? No need to thank me for that.",
        "Again with the studying and the training? You're so stubborn you make Ingrid and His Highness seem downright easygoing. My advice on the whole thing is just to follow your instincts. That's what I do. If someone's in trouble, I help them. You don't need to be a valiant knight to know that. Doesn't matter if the person is an ugly old man or the cutest girl you've ever seen, you help 'em.",
        "Everybody's the same, deep down. It's our job to help anyone who needs it.",
        "What? You're looking at me funny. Did I say something wrong?",
        "Was that a compliment? I can't tell.",
        "Heh heh, how did you say that with a straight face?! I'd be embarrassed if I were you. Come on, Ashe. You're an honest and overall great guy. You'll be an honest and overall great knight too. Of course, people like you need to watch out for greedy people.",
        "Remember when I said I didn't need any thanks? Well, I didn't say anything about not wanting a reward. There's a girl, and we...we had a misunderstanding about who was allowed to date who, so...uh... I need to hang out in your room until everything calms down. Should only be a day...or two...tops.",
        "Come on, Ashe. Remember? If someone's in trouble, you help them! You want to be a great knight, yeah?",
        "All right! I knew I could count on you. You'll definitely be a great knight.",
        "Mercedes! You look divine, as always? Are you off to pray?",
        "Well, because I've been watching your lovely—",
        "I won't lie. I do enjoy beholding women... But I don't mean it like that with you. I know I sound like a dope. I just—I think you're special.",
        "You're beautiful. And I mean that. You're... Uh, how can I put it without sounding even worse? OK, here goes... I want to get to know you better, as friends, I mean.",
        "Well, what's something you like?",
        "You grew up in the Empire, didn't you?",
        "Bartels? I thought you were born to House Martritz?",
        "I don't mean to be nosy...if it's too personal.",
        "Oh...",
        "You think the Bartels were just using her to secure a Crest?",
        "So you grew up in a church. OK, it makes more sense now why you're praying all the time.",
        "Right...and I interrupted you. Well, see you around, Mercedes.",
        "House Bartels wanted a Crest and ruined other people's lives to get one. These idiots are all the same.",
        "Mercedes, I swear the whole cathedral glows with heavenly light when you're around.",
        "I'm here because you're here. And I don't care about other girls.",
        "Actually, I've only said it to girls who thought I was lying about being faithfu— You know what? There's no reason to get into all that. The truth is I would really like to spend some time with you. What do you say to that?",
        "I agree. I've been such an idiot in the past, always angling for the seduction... I've forgotten how to just talk to someone.",
        "Dull? No. I was worried that I'd made you remember unhappy times. It's horrible what you had to go through. It's not like anyone chooses to be born with a Crest.",
        "Are you asking me how being born with a Crest affected me? It's not a very happy story.",
        "Would you want to know more about me even if I didn't have a Crest or come from a noble family?",
        "You...you do? Here's the short version—I hate Crests. Even though having one is supposed to be such a great blessing, mine has ruined everything. Miklan was heir to our house. Then I was born, and I became the heir because I had a Crest. That made my older brother jealous enough to want to kill me. And every woman in Fódlan wants to have my little Crest baby so they can join the nobility. Yeah... There you go. That's what it's like to have a Crest.",
        "No, I...I should keep my temper better. I don't want you to see me act that way.",
        "Of course! I think I love you! And I mean that. With all my heart. I love you, Mercedes! Let's get married and have Crest babies!",
        "Mercedes! You're looking divine, as always.",
        "Just the two of us meeting at this time of night? You move quicker than I thought.",
        "Ah, OK... I probably should have figured that out.",
        "Huh? Me?",
        "All the Kingdom's noble houses expect a lot from their heirs. I'm no different from any other noble guy or gal. We've all got responsibilities.",
        "Thinking about it, life was probably a lot harder for my brother than it ever has been for me.",
        "Um, I'd appreciate it if you maybe kept that observation between the two of us.",
        "I know you've got your share of bad memories too, but...",
        "Mercedes... Was my sad smile really that bad? Did it ruin my dashing good looks?",
        "Aw, here come the waterworks...",
        "I will. I promise. You know, Mercedes, you really are a special lady.",
        "Hey, Annette. Hitting the magic books again? Has anyone ever told you that you're pretty cute when you're studying?",
        "How can you stay focused reading a book that thick...with such small print? Is some of that text upside down?",
        "You're even cuter when you're working through a difficult problem.",
        "Hang on. Look at the third line. You've got the formula wrong.",
        "Well, I mean, it's written right there...",
        "Nope, this is the first time. OK, now that I look at it... Wow. This book makes things way more complicated than they need to be.",
        "It's just describing another application for the same formula. Ha! This is pretty easy!",
        "Nah, hanging out with girls is way more fun. I guess I just picked this stuff up somewhere. Life is short, Annette. If you waste it working hard, it'll be over before you know it. Get out in the world. Have some fun!",
        "Uh...",
        "No, I was just thinking that you're pretty cute when you're sulking. You know that?",
        "Hey, uh, I just got lucky with that stuff in the book. I'd normally never be able to outsmart you. Anyway...I'm gonna get out of here and leave you to it.",
        "Uh-oh. Did I do something wrong? Did you spot me sneaking back in this morning? Or is it about that girl who got mad I kissed her sister good-night... I can explain either way.",
        "Nah, I just like giving other people the spotlight.",
        "I did take those things to heart. We're friends, right? I'd be sad if you started to hate me. There's just one thing I want you to remember. Guys like me who hate hard work and sorta get by on our wits? It all falls apart eventually. I'm smart enough to know that. So I respect people like you. I mean it.",
        "Huh?",
        "Let me put this a different way... I've always been treated like I'm special, and I'm not. At least, I don't think I am. I'm just tired of people thinking they know what I can and can't do. When everybody expects something of you or envies you...it's kind of suffocating. I'd rather people think I'm dumb. Well, I mean, I can still be pretty dumb. Heh...",
        "Heh, competition, huh? I like the sound of that. Where the heck were you when I was growing up? If I had someone like you back then, I think I may have turned out different. Better, I mean. Anyway, I'd love to chat more with you. Would you like to grab some tea with me or...",
        "Oh, I see. Some other time then. I look forward to it, Annette.",
        "That was quite a sigh. What's wrong, Ingrid?",
        "You're my friend...one of my oldest, in fact.",
        "Heh, nobody asked you to do that. Heck, I thought you enjoyed it. Besides, you're real good at it. I'm excited to continue working with you.",
        "Please don't yell like that. Everybody's staring at us.",
        "Come on. I was eight and she was gorgeo— That was a long time ago.",
        "People can hear you! Please be quiet.",
        "Wait a second. That was just an accident...a tragic, tragic accident.",
        "You know what? This conversation is over. I'm done.",
        "Fine, I promise I'll try to change. Are you happy now?",
        "That's a heavy sigh...again.",
        "Apologizing? I've been pretty damned restrained lately.",
        "Ha! If I get bitten, that's all just part of the game. Heck, I had one girl's brother come after me with a pitchfork. Heh heh...",
        "I'm sorry. I was being... You're right. I know what it did to you when he died. It hurt to see you hurt and not be able to do anything. When you wouldn't even come out of your room to take care of your horse...",
        "Well, I'm happy that you're better. Seeing you out and about helped me relax enough to be able to flirt with girls again.",
        "Me?",
        "Huh... The truth really does hurt.",
        "OK... I promise.",
        "Training on your own? You really do work hard.",
        "You're here, aren't you?",
        "You'd really say something like that to a handsome guy like me? I'm crushed! Joking aside, may I join you? I only came out here so I could train too.",
        "I've been thinking about it, and I really depend on you. Maybe that's weird since I'm older than you, but still...",
        "No! I'm being honest! I thought you'd listen. Hey, I'd like it if you didn't get too far away from me on the battlefield, OK? Just stay where I can see you.",
        "What? No, I'm saying if there's one thing I can do on the battlefield, it's keep you safe.",
        "Heh, I'm pretty sure that's my line.",
        "You're right. I'm exhausted anyway.",
        "I just, uh... Well, you're going to think I'm being a jerk or hitting on you or whatever... When we're side by side like this, training, I feel—I don't know—oddly at ease.",
        "That must be it. Let's never change. Friends forever?",
        "Hey, Ingrid. How are you— I mean, what are you— Are you... you know... off to train again?",
        "Oh, I just thought you look serious as ever. I guess that part of you hasn't changed.",
        "Yeah, no... I mean, I guess you're right. Heh heh...",
        "No. I'm pretty sure. I don't think so. By the by, have you, ya know, fallen for anybody recently?",
        "Well everyone's been talking about how you got really, uh, pretty. Just, you know, all of a sudden.",
        "Huh? No, I... I think it looks good. You did surprisingly well. I mean, considering that it's you.",
        "What? No, I'm not! I'm just, ya know, curious about why... all of a sudden.",
        "I'm still guessing it's for a guy. If I had to try and guess what sort of guy, I suppose I'd say...",
        "Felix? No, wait, I'm forgetting the royal line. Dimitri would be a way better catch.",
        "Is it one of the knights? If it's not them... Wait. Could it be me?!",
        "No need for violence. It was just a joke! Um, I mean... It's not a joke that you're beautiful, but I wasn't trying to hit on you or anything. Promise.",
        "Hey, Bernadetta. You look pretty happy. Celebrating something?",
        "Hey, relax! It's OK if you'd rather not tell me. By the way, I believe you left something in the library... A half-written manuscript? Your own work, I presume? I was curious who it belonged to and gave it a read-through. You're a really talented writer!",
        "I'm sorry. I peeked at the first page then the next, and I couldn't stop. I think it's good enough to publish. It's the kind of adventure story that will make people laugh and cry! I love how you never know what mess the hero is going to get herself into next. I'm dying to read more!",
        "Uh, your mouth's hanging wide open. Bernadetta? Are you OK?",
        "Yes? That would be me. I read your book.",
        "Yeah, and I loved it!",
        "Humiliated? No, I think the word you're looking for is \"humbled\" because — and she's gone. Now what do I do with this book?",
        "Heya, Bernadetta. Did you read my letter?",
        "I'm sorry, but I fell head over heels for your story. It's so good, and I just had to tell you about it. So what do you say? Will you write more? Why don't we talk literature over some tea?",
        "Ah, Dorothea! I've been preparing to do just that, as it were. My intention is to flirt with the monastery's most beautiful flower...Dorothea herself!",
        "Heh heh... Oh, Dorothea, your wit is as sharp as your beauty. Don't you want just a little flirting? Just a sample? I'm not like all the others, you know.",
        "And that is supposed to mean...what exactly?",
        "Me? Hate women? Haha! That couldn't be further from the truth! I'm always serious when it comes to matters of the heart. When I flirt, I stake my life on it.",
        "That's what I've been saying! I love you enough to stake my life on it. And I'm seriously in love with each and every girl I flirt with.",
        "She's stone cold... I love it.",
        "Ah, Dorothea. What are you doing here?",
        "Were you going to invite me out to dinner? I accept.",
        "How about tonight? I'm busy tomorrow...",
        "Heh heh, isn't it an unwritten rule not to ask about such things? But what a curious turn of events. Have you perhaps got an ulterior motive?",
        "No, wait! That's not what I meant. I just don't understand why you want my company now...when you've always been so cold to me. Have you perhaps...fallen in love with me?",
        "Fine, fine. I get it. You want someone to chase your loneliness away.",
        "Don't dream of it. It would be my pleasure, milady. And to be clear...the reason you chose to spend time with me is my family, yes? Or is it my Crest? Both? I'm just curious about such things. Say I was a commoner. Would you still have invited me to dinner?",
        "That's a difficult question. I have nothing against mature women, but...",
        "Heh, you little... Eh, that's probably true. So, Dorothea, about that dinner?",
        "Even if I was an old man or an orphan, huh?",
        "Ah, why have I been so unlucky with women lately?",
        "Heh, isn't there an unwritten rule you shouldn't ask someone that?",
        "I'm sad every time I break up with someone! It's just, I usually try to be the one doing the breaking up. I've never had a hard time with girls...ever. Not until recently. But now when I think about it, I wonder what any of them even liked about me. It's not as if any of them knew much about me. I don't get it.",
        "I asked you before, if you would have invited me out if I was a peasant.",
        "That was wrong of me to say. I've just... It's not an excuse, but I'm always so suspicious. I'm a nobleman with a Crest. The marriage proposals don't stop coming. Everyone wants me. Except they don't actually want me at all. They want my bloodline. Within my family and without, it's always the same story. Sometimes I think that if I didn't have a Crest, no one would look at me twice.",
        "Oh? What sort of thoughts might those be?",
        "Heh, I'm pretty sure I've heard this somewhere.",
        "Yeah, I suppose we are. Look, Dorothea. I've realized something. Even if you were an old grandma, I'd still flirt with you...and I'd absolutely win you over. Though, I'd much rather win you over now...and be with you until you become an old grandma.",
        "Well, before any of that, will you go to dinner with me?",
        "Ho-ho! Oh, wow. That was... I'm sorry I saw that, but I am so glad that I saw that.",
        "Oh, OK. I'm glad you explained it because I thought you just got rejected, just flat-out, no-way-to-make-yourself-feel-better-about-it-rejected. And the reason, Your Nobleness, is because that is really not the way you go about hitting on a girl.",
        "Pay attention, kid. Maybe you'll learn something.",
        "When I saw you, I just had to come over and say hello because finding you here...feels like fate. Maybe we could go get some tea. Get to know each other better?",
        "That's weird. Girls...usually fall for that speech. You must have spooked her.",
        "Please! I'm a much better heir than a self-important failure like you.",
        "You took the words right out of my mouth.",
        "I just wanted to say that I've been watching, and I'm really impressed with how hard you work. Very dedicated for someone so young.",
        "I really admire your...everything. But, ya know, everybody needs to relax now and then. I was wondering if maybe you and me could...",
        "Lorenz, ever since you started hanging around, I've had no luck. Usually, if I show a girl I'm mature, noble, and interested, she's an easy catch.",
        "Shallow? What, like Your Nobleness is some properly cultured man of the world?",
        "Hah! Why, yes, your silky bearing was quite impressive. You're always going on about nobility, but that's no way to win a woman. Your problem, and I may have told you this before—at least twice—your problem is, you're pretentious.",
        "All I'm failing to see is you getting a girl's attention!",
        "Ugh, listen. I'm sorry. That was mean. And you're probably right about me not being serious enough.",
        "It's the same in battle, isn't it? If you don't bend a little, you fail.",
        "Yeah... With that being said...",
        "Bring it on, Lorenz!",
        "Lysithea, I have to say you're really impressive. I respect you a lot, and I thought I should tell you.",
        "It's just, you know, you're four years younger than me, but you work really hard at everything. I mean, when I was your age, I wasted all my time just goofing off and doing whatever I wanted.",
        "Are you going to do some extra magic training? I'd be happy to join you, if you don't mind. What do you want to start with?",
        "What? No! Age has nothing to do with it. You're amazing! You're true to yourself. You know what you want and who you are. Not a lot of girls I know can say that.",
        "I— what? Where did you get that idea? I'm just trying to praise your smarts and hard work and everything. It's impressive how someone so young—",
        "What I'm aware of is you trying to pick a fight. Calm down, kiddo.",
        "And what would that be?",
        "No, but I do.",
        "Hey Lysithea. I was about to grab some food. Would you like to come along?",
        "Great. Let's go.",
        "Hmm... The dining hall isn't exactly relaxing, is it? If there's a next time, I'll take you somewhere with a much better atmosphere.",
        "Nah, I get why you told me off. There's nothing you need to apologize for.",
        "But I think you're a genius! And you work harder than I ever did. When I was your age...",
        "Ah, so I already told you that... What a perfect memory you have.",
        "Heh... Look, I'm sorry, OK? I know how hard you work, and I really wasn't trying to upset you. I just wanted to chat.",
        "Seriously? It sure didn't seem that way...",
        "An apology? That is not how these conversations usually turn out. There's no need for that though. Really, you'll make me blush if you keep this up. Listen, Lysithea, I want you to know that I meant every word. Even if sincerity is... difficult for me. You're as lovely as you are clever, and you have this strange charm about you. That's what I really honestly think.",
        "I swear to you, it isn't false at all! And it's not flattery if it's the truth.",
        "Sweet and tolerant! You never cease to amaze.",
        "Heh heh... I have to say, Lysithea, your harshness is one of those things I find so charming about you!",
        "Hello, Marianne. All done for the day?",
        "Well then, my timing couldn't be better. I was just heading into town, and I thought maybe you'd like to join me?",
        "I heard a story once about a beautiful maiden who was locked up in a monastery day and night. She was held prisoner by her own fear of the outside world. Then a brave knight set the girl free and took her to town where they drank tea and talked for hours. So, my fair maiden...",
        "Margrave Edmund wants to keep you locked up, huh? I've heard he's...let's call it ambitious. Well, just tell him who I am. I think he'd approve. I'm heir to House Gautier, one of the most prominent families in the Kingdom. I've got a Crest, I've got money, and I'm stunningly handsome. What's that face for, Marianne? Was it the handsome thing? I can see how that might have been a bit much.",
        "Oh, no—no—no. I didn't mean you should find my Crest impressive. I meant your family would, and— You know what? Maybe I should start over.",
        "Oh. OK. I've got to get going anyway. Places to be, ya know. Well, this is me going...",
        "But remember...should you ever need me, I will forever be your knight, my maiden.",
        "Hello, Marianne.",
        "Won't you at least tell me why you're avoiding me? It hurts. It really does.",
        "I told you I'm on your side, and I meant it. I'm guessing you don't much like talking about Crests. Call it a hunch.",
        "I'm the same way, ya know. The value of my life has always been dictated by the damn thing. It's not fair to have your worth determined by something you can't control. Growing up in House Gautier taught me that the hard way.",
        "I like to think it's a person's smile.",
        "A smile, it tells you who someone is. Are they fake or sincere? It also makes you feel stronger when you smile. My smile helps me focus and set free all of that power I never asked for. Hm, I wonder... Try it out, Marianne! Be strong-willed, and put everything you've got into your smile.",
        "Yeesh, that's a terr—rrific first try...if a bit stiff. Lift the corners of your lips just a bit. Oh, I know! Try saying, \"cheese!\"",
        "Hey, that was good! It might feel a bit unnatural, but you'll get used to it soon enough.",
        "Guaranteed. It's a great smile, you know. Let's go to town and show it off. If you lift your eyes from the ground, you'll see that the world has all sorts of amazing things to offer. The more you realize that, the more you'll smile.",
        "Please, don't let me pressure you. If you don't want to go, I understand.",
        "Oh yeah? That sounds great. I can't wait to see your best smile.",
        "Hey there, Hilda! You're looking cute today.",
        "You know exactly how to talk to a guy. I like it.",
        "What's with all the books?",
        "What's wrong? Did you hurt your foot?",
        "Relax. I'm sure there's a handsome guy around here who knows how to carry books to the library.",
        "You rest your foot. I'll take care of this.",
        "Nothing is more important than helping you. Just pile the books on that desk, and I'll get 'em where they're going.",
        "It's nothing. I'm happy to — Wow. That is a lot of books.",
        "Wait a minute. Some of these books have dust on them. She's been holding on to these for months!",
        "The professor was looking for this one a few weeks ago! Hilda...",
        "Hang on! Did she just trick me into doing something she didn't want to do?",
        "Hilda! Lovely as ever. I swear when you're around the sun shines brighter and everything sparkles.",
        "Thank you. Are you going out today?",
        "If you do, then be careful. I'd hate to think you might hurt your foot again.",
        "I noticed, you know, since I'm always looking at cute girls and you are one of the cuter ones...",
        "Your foot was better during the battle. You were running all over, just a regular warrior princess! And less than a day after such a terrible injury...",
        "Hilda, please don't lie to me.",
        "I knew your foot wasn't really hurt, but I returned your books anyway.",
        "Take it from a guy who does his fair share of pretending to be someone he's not...and I say this as a friend...You are a terrible liar.",
        "And those books you left in your room for so long? Teachers and classmates needed those. So stop lying, and maybe stop being quite as selfish too.",
        "Oh yeah. I got an earful of yelling and accusations meant for you.",
        "Nah. I figured the librarian would feel better if they just let loose. No reason to make them wait for you.",
        "Tell you what. All will be forgiven if you promise three things — stop lying, take responsibility, and fall madly in love with me.",
        "What? Why not?",
        "Your brother sounds...terrifying, actually.",
        "Ha! Well, I'll take what I can get. Just don't go causing troubles for guys who aren't me.",
        "Well hello there, gorgeous. You're looking lovely today. Join me on a stroll around town?",
        "Aw, is another sweet girl like you doing all this hard work by yourself? That's no good. Allow me to help.",
        "Oh, hey Leonie. Sorry, but I'm kind of in a hurry right now.",
        "Whoa. No need to yell. Do you need something?",
        "What a terrible thing to say! I see a girl, I figure it would be rude to just pass her by without at least a wink... or a nice word. But you knew that. So I'm going to get going now. See ya, Leonie.",
        "Me? Pass who now?",
        "Uh... Oh, I see. A girl. You're... a girl. Huh. Sorry, I know it's true in theory, but it looks like my brain just didn't want to accept it. But you're correct. You are a beautiful girl in your own right. Yes. That is a statement with which I agree. I am ever so terribly sorry for being so rude, my lady. How can I ever make this up to you?",
        "Seriously, I feel just dreadful about how I acted! This is the first time I've ever done anything like this. I'm shocked that I'm capable of such low behavior. Even if you are a somewhat crude— I mean, spirited girl, that doesn't excuse my...",
        "R-right... Of course... I'm sorry. I can't believe I was so thoughtless.",
        "Hey, Leonie. I mean... Hello, beautiful. What brings a sweet girl like you to a place like this?",
        "Nothing much. Nothing... Much... I was just thinking about how sunflowers don't deserve to be stuffed away in a greenhouse. They'd bloom much better out in the open! Just like you.",
        "No! Okay, that compliment backfired. Let me try a different angle...",
        "What have you got against sunflowers, anyway? I think they're lovely, myself. If you think I only care about delicate flowers raised in a greenhouse, you've got me all wrong. Statuesque sunflowers, blooming proud and tall in the open air, have a beauty all their own.",
        "You better believe it, and the same goes for you. You have a beauty unlike any other. I look at you, I see sunflowers.",
        "Mm?",
        "At this point, I feel like anything I say is just going to make you more angry.",
        "My eyes have been opened to the charms of the beautiful flower blooming right beside me. It's a whole new day for my heart.",
        "I'm not. I'm absolutely serious. You really are as charming as any flower. I see that now.",
        "Even sincerity doesn't work? What kind of flirting is going to satisfy you? You know what? I'm just going to leave you alone for now, so I can get a fresh start some other time.",
        "Hey there, Flayn. I thought I'd drop by and see if you'd care for a...",
        "Excuse me?",
        "Seteth said that? I bet he also told you any woman who comes too close to me is... How does he say it? Doomed to misfortune...",
        "Come on. He's just messing with you, obviously.",
        "I hate to suggest my talents are being oversold, but...",
        "Do I really look like such a villain to you?",
        "When you put it like that, I feel like I should defend— Eh, forget it. Let's get to the actual point.",
        "It's kind of awkward talking from so far away. Can I please step just a little...",
        "Oh, come on! Who would even... You should know that your brother has an overactive imagination.",
        "I may not be the most respectable fella you'll ever meet, but...",
        "Flayn! Wait! Come back! ...And she's gone. All I was trying to do was deliver a message. Flayn! Hey! The professor said we need to come to the cathedral! I'll run really far ahead so you don't have to walk near me! There. I tried telling her. The professor can't be mad about that.",
        "Hi! Why do you look so down? But hey, if you're talking to me of your own accord... Can I assume you've figured out I'm not a monster?",
        "Nothing to be upset about. I mean, I've kind of earned that reputation. I've just...I've got this sickness. When I see a pretty girl, I can't stop myself from flirting with her. Like you, for instance...",
        "Huh? No, I didn't mean it like that...",
        "You know what? Let's just... Let's move on. Can I take this to mean everything is good between us?",
        "Great! Would you like to celebrate our new friendship by joining me for a meal?",
        "A chance to spend time with a sweet girl like yourself? It's a pleasure. Your voice is like birdsong, your eyes clear as diamonds, but above all... I'm drawn to your kind and loving heart. I am a captive to your charms, Flayn.",
        "Yeah, I... I guess a girl as cute as you would get a lot of compliments.",
        "Ha, she's a tough one. Sheltered girls like her usually fall for that kind of stuff. But she's much too savvy...even for a smooth talker like myself.",
        "How are you feeling, Professor Manuela?",
        "You don't remember? Well, you collapsed in the infirmary, and–",
        "Anyway, I found you passed out on the floor, helped you up, then carried you back here.",
        "No... Nope. I was definitely alone. I just, ya know, I just had a bad feeling, and I decided to look around to see if anyone needed my help.",
        "Are you all right? Here, have some water.",
        "That good-for-nothing guy who strung you along, whispered sweet nothings in your ear, then shattered your heart beyond repair? I agree. He's a jerk.",
        "Actually, your version had more details. Very detailed details.",
        "You know, Professor, you're a good catch. It's a shame that you've had no luck with men. You need a guy like me–somebody who sees your beauty and appreciates how tender you are, emotionally...and how much love you have to give.",
        "Sure, sure, I can take a hint. Rest up, Manuela.",
        "You know, you're a good catch. It's a shame that you've had no luck with men. You need a guy like me—somebody who sees your beauty and appreciates how tender you are, emotionally...and how much love you have to give.",
        "Do I look dishonest? Are these the eyes of a guy who is just playing around?",
        "As long as it's just the two of us and the only subject is love, I'll follow you anywhere."
